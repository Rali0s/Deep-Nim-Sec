While this will work for NIST:

# Examples to match:
#   AC-1
#   RA-5.1
#   AC-2(1)
#   AC-2(12).1    (edge but seen in some derivative docs)
#
# ID groups:
#   fam: AC|AT|...
#   base_num: 1..n
#   dot_part: .1 (optional)
#   enh: (1) (optional)
#   enh_dot: .1 after enhancement (optional)
#

1. We are matching a known Dictionary Family Already
2. More Universal Design:
A. Working In PlainText UTF-8
A1. Convert To PlainText
B. Start Line -> Read Until (.?!:;)
C. Create Code_ID for COL-1
D. Take Start to end of B add ',' and COL-2

This brings me to needing a Unified Set of Family Groups & Codes.
MITRE is massive - NIST Is Concise. We also need to have all of the mapped prior, in a perfect world.

After Family ID Groups are made, We can splice if we run against definitions.
Future issue, no coded sections.
