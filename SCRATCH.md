Concept: InfoSec Educational AI Model
Guidelines: Please Highlight any terms and policy regulations we may come in contact with.
Data: I have datasets in store for model training and custom coding
Language: Python = Main; Node = Backup
Goal: Educational ( Think HTB-HackTheBox but Simpler ) to Operational ( SHODAN Plugin )
Goal-2: Capture New AI Generational Audience & Bring Them From & Through AI to Practical Education

Instructions: 
1. Create Vertex Workflow For App Backend
2. List Process Flow For Model Data, Training, & Python Codebase
3. Example Frontend Plugin

Use-Case:
"Write me a bash port scanner" | "What is a port scanner"
