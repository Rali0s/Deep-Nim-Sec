Organization-defined parameters (ODPs) are included in certain security requirements. ODPs 
provide flexibility through the use of assignment and selection operations to allow federal 
agencies and nonfederal organizations to specify values for the designated parameters in the 
requirements.14
14 NIST does not establish or assign values for ODPs. If ODP values for selected security requirements are not formally established or assigned by 
a federal agency or a consortium of federal agencies, nonfederal organizations must assign those values to complete the requirements. 
 Assignment and selection operations provide the capability to customize the 
security requirements based on specific protection needs. The determination of ODP values can 
be guided and informed by laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, 
guidance, or mission and business needs. Once specified, the values for the organization-
defined parameters become part of the requirement. 
 
ORGANIZATION-DEFINED PARAMETERS 
Organization-defined parameters are an important part of a security requirement specification. 
ODPs provide both the flexibility and specificity needed by organizations to clearly define their CUI 
security requirements, given the diverse nature of their missions, business functions, operational 
environments, and risk tolerance. In addition, ODPs support consistent security assessments in 
determining whether specified security requirements have been satisfied. If a federal agency or a 
consortium of agencies do not specify a particular value or range of values for an ODP, nonfederal 
organizations must assign the value or values to complete the security requirement. 
A d
iscussion section is included with each requirement. It is derived from the control discussion 
sections in SP 800-53 and provides additional information to facilitate the implementation and 
assessment of the requirements. The discussion section is informative, not normative. It is not 
intended to extend the scope of a requirement or influence the solutions that organizations 
may use to satisfy a requirement. The use of examples is notional, not exhaustive, and does not 
reflect the potential options available to organizations. A references section provides the source"
SC-13,"Supporting Publications: : FIPS 140-3 [38] 
The term organization is used in many security requirements, and its meaning depends on 
context. For example, in a security requirement with an ODP, an organization can refer to either 
the federal agency or the nonfederal organization establishing the parameter values for the 
requirement. 
Appendix C describes the security control tailoring criteria used to develop the security 
requirements and the results of the tailoring process. The appendix provides a list of controls 
from SP 800-53 that support the requirements and the controls that have been eliminated from 
the moderate baseline in accordance with the tailoring criteria. 
  
 
ASSESSING SECURITY REQUIREMENTS 
SP 800-171A [84] provides a set of procedures to assess the security requirements described in 
this publication. The assessment procedures are based on the procedures described in SP 800-53A

03.01.05    Least Privilege 
a. Allow only authorized system access for users (or processes acting on behalf of 
users) that is necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks. 
b. Authorize access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions] and 
[Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant information]. 
c. Review the privileges assigned to roles or classes of users [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency] to validate the need for such privileges. 
d. Reassign or remove privileges, as necessary. 
DISCUSSION 
Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and 
authorized access for users and system processes. Least privilege is applied to the 
development, implementation, and operation of the system. Organizations consider 
creating additional processes, roles, and system accounts to achieve least privilege. 
Security functions include establishing system accounts and assigning privileges, 
installing software, configuring access authorizations, configuring settings for events 
to be audited, establishing vulnerability scanning parameters, establishing intrusion 
detection parameters, and managing audit information. Security-relevant 
information includes threat and vulnerability information, filtering rules for routers 
or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, security architecture, 
cryptographic key management information, access control lists, and audit 
information."

03.01.10    Device Lock 
a. Prevent access to the system by [Selection (one or more): initiating a device lock 
after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity; requiring the 
user to initiate a device lock before leaving the system unattended]. 
b. Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using established 
identification and authentication procedures. 
c. Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a 
publicly viewable image. 
DISCUSSION 
Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent access to the system when 
users depart from the immediate vicinity of the system but do not want to log out 
due to the temporary nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at 
the operating system level or application level. User-initiated device locking is 
behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to initiate the 
device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of the 
system (e.g., when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays). 
Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images, such as patterns used 
with screen savers, solid colors, photographic images, a clock, a battery life 
indicator, or a blank screen with the caveat that controlled unclassified information 
is not displayed."

2. When required by system changes or following [Assignment: organization-
defined events], and 
3. On recognizing and reporting indicators of insider threat, social engineering, 
and social mining. 
b. Update security literacy training content [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events].  
DISCUSSION 
Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of security literacy training to 
system users (including managers, senior executives, system administrators, and 
contractors) and measures to test the knowledge level of users. Organizations 
determine the content of literacy training based on specific organizational 
requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized access, and work 
environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the need 
for security and the actions required of users to maintain security and respond to 
incidents. The content also addresses the need for operations security and the 
handling of CUI. 
Security awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed 
with security reminders, generating email advisories or notices from organizational 
officials, displaying logon screen messages, and conducting awareness events using 
podcasts, videos, and webinars. Security literacy training is conducted at a frequency 
consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Updating 
literacy training content on a regular basis ensures that the content remains 
relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy training content include"

a. Specify the following event types selected for logging within the system: 
[Assignment: organization-defined event types]. 
b. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment:

DISCUSSION 
An event is any observable occurrence in a system, including unlawful or 
unauthorized system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging 
functionality is needed. This includes events that are relevant to the security of 
systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and 
ongoing auditing needs. Event types can include password changes, the execution of 
privileged functions, failed logons or accesses related to systems, administrative 
privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that 
require logging, organizations consider the system monitoring and auditing that are 
appropriate for each of the security requirements. When defining event types, 
organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related events, such as the"

includes time stamps, source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, 
event descriptions, file names, and the access control or flow control rules that are 
invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and 
event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the system after the event 
occurred). Detailed information that organizations consider in audit records may 
include a full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of 
group account users."

03.03.05    Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting 
a. Review and analyze system audit records [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] for indications and the potential impact of inappropriate or unusual 
activity. 
b. Report findings to organizational personnel or roles. 
c. Analyze and correlate audit records across different repositories to gain 
organization-wide situational awareness. 
DISCUSSION 
Audit record review, analysis, and reporting cover information security logging 
performed by organizations and can include logging that results from the monitoring 
of account usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, configuration settings, the 
use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance, system component inventory, 
mobile device connection, equipment delivery and removal, physical access, 
temperature and humidity, communications at system interfaces, and the use of 
mobile code. Findings can be reported to organizational entities, such as the incident 
response team, help desk, and security or privacy offices. If organizations are 
prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit records or unable to conduct such 
activities, the review or analysis may be carried out by other organizations granted 
such authority. The scope, frequency, and/or depth of the audit record review, 
analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to meet organizational needs based on new 
information received. Correlating audit record review, analysis, and reporting 
processes helps to ensure that audit records collectively create a more complete 
view of events.

a. Use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records. 
b. Record time stamps for audit records that meet [Assignment: organization-
defined granularity of time measurement] and that use Coordinated Universal 
Time (UTC), have a fixed local time offset from UTC, or include the local time 
offset as part of the time stamp. 
DISCUSSION 
Time stamps generated by the system include the date and time. Time is often 
expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) — a modern continuation of 
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) — or local time with an offset from UTC. The 
granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between 
system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within hundreds or 
tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time granularities for 
system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities (e.g., 
access control and identification and authentication), depending on the nature of 
the mechanisms used to support those capabilities."

03.03.08    Protection of Audit Information 
a. Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, 
modification, and deletion. 
b. Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to only a subset 
of privileged users or roles. 
DISCUSSION 
Audit information includes the information needed to successfully audit system 
activity, such as audit records, audit log settings, audit reports, and personally 
identifiable information. Audit logging tools are programs and devices used to 
conduct audit and logging activities. The protection of audit information focuses on 
technical protection and limits the ability to access and execute audit logging tools 
to authorized individuals. The physical protection of audit information is addressed 
by media and physical protection requirements. 
Individuals or roles with privileged access to a system and who are also the subject 
of an audit by that system may affect the reliability of the audit information by 
inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. Requiring privileged access to 
be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges limits the 
number of users or roles with audit-related privileges.

DISCUSSION 
Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, 
software, or firmware components of the system and that affect the security 
posture or functionality of the system. Security-related configuration settings can be 
defined for systems (e.g., servers, workstations), input and output devices (e.g., 
scanners, copiers, printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, 
voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), 
operating systems, middleware, and applications. 
Security parameters are those parameters that impact the security state of the 
system, including the parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. 
Security parameters include registry settings; account, file, and directory permission 
settings (i.e., privileges); and settings for functions, ports, protocols, and remote 
connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and"

DISCUSSION 
Configuration change control refers to tracking, reviewing, approving or 
disapproving, and logging changes to the system. Specifically, it involves the 
systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition 
of changes to the system, including system upgrades and modifications. 
Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations for system 
components (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, mobile 
devices) and configuration items of the system, changes to configuration settings, 
unscheduled and unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities.

DISCUSSION 
Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication are 
defined by type, device, or a combination of type and device. Organization-defined 
device types include devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use 
shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC], Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or 
organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers [IEEE] 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], RADIUS server 
with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and 
authenticate devices on local and wide area networks. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 
and certificate revocation checking for the certificates exchanged can be included as 
part of device authentication.

DISCUSSION 
This requirement applies to user accounts. Multi-factor authentication requires the 
use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The authentication 
factors are defined as follows: something you know (e.g., a personal identification 
number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical authenticator, such as a 
cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multi-factor 
authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware 
authenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart 
cards. In addition to authenticating users at the system level, organizations may also

compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media include paper and 
microfilm. Physically controlling stored media includes conducting inventories, 
establishing procedures to allow individuals to check out and return media to 
libraries, and maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes a 
locked drawer, desk, or cabinet or a controlled media library. Controlled areas 
provide physical and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for 
protecting information and systems. Sanitization techniques (e.g., destroying, 
cryptographically erasing, clearing, and purging) prevent the disclosure of CUI to 
unauthorized individuals. The sanitization process removes CUI from media such 
that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed."

03.08.03    Media Sanitization 
Sanitize system media that contain CUI prior to disposal, release out of 
organizational control, or release for reuse. 
DISCUSSION 
Media sanitization applies to digital and non-digital media that are subject to 
disposal or reuse, whether or not the media are considered removable. Examples 
include digital media in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, mobile 
devices, workstations, network components, and non-digital media. The sanitization 
process removes CUI from media such that the information cannot be retrieved or 
reconstructed. Sanitization techniques (e.g., cryptographically erasing, clearing, 
purging, and destroying) prevent the disclosure of CUI to unauthorized individuals 
when such media are reused or released for disposal. NARA policies control the 
sanitization process for media that contain CUI and may require destruction when 
other methods cannot be applied to the media.

b. Maintain accountability of system media that contain CUI during transport 
outside of controlled areas. 
c. Document activities associated with the transport of system media that contain 
CUI. 
DISCUSSION 
System media include digital and non-digital media. Digital media include flash 
drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic 
drives, compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media include microfilm 
and paper. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or 
procedural measures to meet the requirements established for protecting CUI and 
systems. Media protection during transport can include cryptography and/or locked 
containers. Activities associated with media transport include releasing media for 
transport, ensuring that media enter the appropriate transport processes, and the 
actual transport. Authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals 
external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of media during transport 
includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking or 
obtaining the records of transport activities as the media move through the 
transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. This 
requirement is related to 03.13.08 and 03.13.11

03.08.07    Media Use 
a. Restrict or prohibit the use of [Assignment: organization-defined types of system 
media].  
b. Prohibit the use of removable system media without an identifiable owner. 
DISCUSSION 
In contrast to requirement 03.08.01, which restricts user access to media, this 
requirement restricts or prohibits the use of certain types of media, such as external 
hard drives, flash drives, or smart displays. Organizations can use technical and non-
technical measures (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control the 
use of system media. For example, organizations may control the use of portable 
storage devices by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to 
external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read, or write to devices. 
Organizations may limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved 
devices, including devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other 
approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Organizations 
may also control the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device — 
prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices — and implement this restriction 
by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Limits on the use of 
organization-controlled system media in external systems include restrictions on 
how the media may be used and under what conditions. Requiring identifiable 
owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for removable system media 
reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to assign 
responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the media 
(e.g., insertion of malicious code).

03.09.02    Personnel Termination and Transfer 
a. When individual employment is terminated: 
1. Disable system access within [Assignment: organization-defined time period], 
2. Terminate or revoke authenticators and credentials associated with the 
individual, and 
3. Retrieve security-related system property. 
b. When individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions in the 
organization: 
1. Review and confirm the ongoing operational need for current logical and 
physical access authorizations to the system and facility, and 
2. Modify access authorization to correspond with any changes in operational 
need. 
DISCUSSION 
Security-related system property includes hardware authentication tokens, system 
administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit 
interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security constraints 
imposed by being former employees and that accountability is achieved for the 
organizational property. Security topics at exit interviews include reminding 
individuals of potential limitations on future employment and non-disclosure 
agreements. Exit interviews may not always be possible for some individuals, 
including in cases related to the unavailability of supervisors, illnesses, or job 
abandonment. 
The timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals who have 
been terminated for cause. Organizations may consider disabling the accounts of 
individuals who are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified. This 
requirement applies to the reassignment or transfer of individuals when the 
personnel action is permanent or of such extended duration as to require 
protection. Protections that may be required for transfers or reassignments to other 
positions within organizations include returning old and issuing new identification 
cards, keys, and building passes; changing system access authorizations (i.e., 
privileges); closing system accounts and establishing new accounts; and providing 
access to official records to which individuals had access at previous work locations 
in previous system accounts."

c. Escort visitors, and control visitor activity. 
d. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices. 
e. Control physical access to output devices to prevent unauthorized individuals 
from obtaining access to CUI. 
DISCUSSION 
This requirement addresses physical locations containing systems or system 
components that process, store, or transmit CUI. Organizations determine the types 
of guards needed, including professional security staff or administrative staff. 
Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, biometric readers, and 
card readers. Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws, Executive 
Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizations 
have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural, 
automated, or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include 
exterior access points, interior access points to systems that require supplemental 
access controls, or both. Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. 
Individuals with permanent physical access authorizations are not considered 
visitors. 
Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing output devices in 
locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or card reader access controls and 
only allowing access to authorized individuals, placing output devices in locations 
that can be monitored by personnel, installing monitor or screen filters, and using

identified. 
b. Remediate system vulnerabilities within [Assignment: organization-defined 
response times]. 
c. Update system vulnerabilities to be scanned [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] and when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported. 
DISCUSSION 
Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for system components 
and ensure that potential sources of vulnerabilities (e.g., networked printers, 
scanners, and copiers) are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom 
software may require additional approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic 
analysis, or binary analysis. Organizations can use these approaches in source code 
reviews and tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary 
analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for 
functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or 
devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating flow 
control mechanisms. 
To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using scanning tools that 
express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming 
convention. Sources for vulnerability information also include the Common 
Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), 
and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

DISCUSSION 
Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. 
Malicious code can be inserted into the system in a variety of ways, including email, 
the internet, and portable storage devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, 
Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats, 
contained in compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as 
steganography. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software 
and custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other 
types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions. 
Periodic scans of the system and real-time scans of files from external sources as 
files are downloaded, opened, or executed can detect malicious code. Malicious 
code protection mechanisms can also monitor systems for anomalous or unexpected 
behaviors and take appropriate actions."

observing other system aspects, such as access patterns, characteristics of access, 
and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the 
events. 
A system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques 
(e.g., audit record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion 
prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network 
monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected 
perimeter locations and near server farms that support critical applications with 
such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of 
monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring 
objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives."

DISCUSSION 
Organizations apply systems security engineering principles to new development 
systems. For legacy systems, organizations apply systems security engineering 
principles to system modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of 
hardware, software, and firmware components. The application of systems security 
engineering principles helps to develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems 
and reduce the susceptibility of organizations to disruptions, hazards, and threats. 
Examples include developing layered protections; establishing security policies, 
architectures, and controls as the foundation for system design; incorporating 
security requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical 
and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to 
build trustworthy secure software; and performing threat modeling to identify use 
cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating 
controls needed to mitigate risk. Organizations that apply security engineering 
principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system 
components, and system services; reduce risks to acceptable levels; and make 
informed risk-management decisions.

c. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure. 
DISCUSSION 
Dependence on the products, systems, and services of external providers and the 
nature of the relationships with those providers present an increasing level of risk to 
an organization. Threat actions that may increase security risks include unauthorized 
production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, poor manufacturing and 
development practices in the supply chain, theft, and the insertion of malicious 
software, firmware, and hardware. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic 
within a system, component, or service. Managing supply chain risks is a complex, 
multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization 
to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external 
stakeholders. 
Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing 
risks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to 
document response actions, and monitoring performance against the plans. The 
system-level SCRM plan is implementation-specific and provides constraints, policy 
implementation, requirements, and implications. It can either be stand-alone or"

03.17.02    Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods 
Develop and implement acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement 
methods to identify, protect against, and mitigate supply chain risks. 
DISCUSSION 
The acquisition process provides an important vehicle for protecting the supply 
chain. There are many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the 
end use of a system or system component, using blind purchases, requiring tamper-
evident packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a 
supply chain risk assessment can inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are 
most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections 
against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, the insertion of counterfeits, the 
insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices 
throughout the system life cycle. 
Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers to implement 
safeguards, promote transparency in their processes and security practices, provide 
contract language that addresses the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit 
components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy suppliers. Organizations 
consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for personnel 
regarding supply chain risks, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs 
should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, 
documentation, and evidence are commensurate with the security requirements of 
the organization. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.
