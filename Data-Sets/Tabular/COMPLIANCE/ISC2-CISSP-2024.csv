Alyssa should use periodic content reviews to continually verify that the content in her program meets the organization's needs and is up-to-date based upon the evolving risk landscape. She may do this using a combination of computer-based training, live training, and gamification, but those techniques do not necessarily verify that the content is updated. 2 . B. The residual risk is the level of risk that remains after controls have been applied to mitigate risks. Inherent risk is the original risk that existed prior to the controls. Control risk is new risk introduced by the addition of controls to the environment. Mitigated risk is the risk that has been addressed by existing controls. 3 . C. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) sets forth the requirements for online service providers when handling copyright complaints received from third parties. The Copyright Act creates the mechanics for issuing and enforcing copyrights but does not cover the actions of online service providers. The Lanham Act regulates the issuance of trademarks to protect intellectual property. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act regulates the handling of personal financial information. 4 . C. The right to erasure, also known as the right to be forgotten, guarantees the data subject the ability to have their information removed from processing or use. It may be tied to consent given for data processing; if a subject revokes consent for processing, the data controller may need to take additional steps, including erasure. 5 . B. Purchasing insurance is a means of transferring risk. If Sally had worked to decrease the likelihood of the events occurring, she would have been using a reduce or risk mitigation strategy, while simply continuing to function as the organization has would be an example of an acceptance strategy. Rejection, or denial of the risk, is not a valid strategy, even though it occurs! 6 . A. Most state data breach notification laws are modeled after California's data breach notification law, which covers Social Security number, driver's license number, state identification card number, credit/debit card numbers, and bank account numbers (in conjunction with a PIN or password). These laws are separate and distinct from privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which regulates the handling of personal information more broadly. 7 . C. Renee's situation calls for an enterprise license agreement as it typically allows customization of terms and pricing, reflecting the negotiated details between the vendor and a corporate client. The license agreement may be written as a perpetual or subscription license, but there is no information provided in the scenario about which one is being used. An end-user license agreement usually accompanies software to dictate the terms of use but is not designed for custom negotiations and pricing agreements. 8 . B. This is a question about who has the standing to bring an ethics complaint. The group of individuals that has standing differs based upon the violated canon. In this case, we are examining Canon IV, which permits any certified or licensed professional who subscribes to a code of ethics to bring charges. Charges of violations of Canons I or II may be brought by anyone. Charges of violations of Canon III may be brought only by a principal with an employer/contractor relationship with the accused. 9 . C. The European Union provides standard contractual clauses that may be used to facilitate data transfer. That would be the best choice in a case where two different companies are sharing data. If the data was being shared internally within a company, binding corporate rules would also be an option. The EU/U.S. Privacy Shield was a safe harbor agreement that would previously have allowed the transfer but is no longer valid. 10 . A. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) contains provisions regulating the privacy of customer financial information. It applies specifically to financial institutions. Among other things, the Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Act regulates the financial reporting activities of publicly traded companies. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulates the handling of protected health information (PHI). The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulates the handling of student educational records. 11 . A. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) specifically applies to government contractors. The Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA) was the precursor to FISMA and expired in November 2002. HIPAA and PCI DSS apply to healthcare and payment card information, respectively. Additionally, PCI DSS is not a law, while FISMA, HIPAA, and GISRA are all laws. 12 . D. The export of encryption software to certain countries is regulated under U.S. export control laws. Memory chips, office productivity applications, and hard drives are less likely to be covered by these regulations, unless they contain hardware dedicated to encryption. 13 . D. In an elevation of privilege attack, the attacker transforms a limited user account into an account with greater privileges, powers, and/or access to the system. Spoofing attacks falsify an identity, while repudiation attacks attempt to deny accountability for an action. Tampering attacks attempt to violate the integrity of information or resources. 14 . D. Whenever you choose to accept a risk, you should maintain detailed documentation of the risk acceptance process to satisfy auditors in the future. This should happen before implementing security controls, designing a disaster recovery plan, or repeating the business impact analysis (BIA). 15 . A, C, D. A fence does not have the ability to detect intrusions. It does, however, have the ability to prevent and deter an intrusion. A fence is an example of a physical control. 16 . D. Tony would see the best results by combining elements of quantitative and qualitative risk assessment. Quantitative risk assessment excels at analyzing financial risk, while qualitative risk assessment is a good tool for intangible risks. Combining the two techniques provides a well-rounded risk picture. 17 . D. The Economic Espionage Act imposes fines and jail sentences on anyone found guilty of stealing trade secrets from a U.S. corporation. It gives true teeth to the intellectual property rights of trade secret owners. Copyright law does not apply in this situation because there is no indication that the information was copyrighted. The Lanham Act applies to trademark protection cases. The Glass-Steagall Act was a banking 126/220 reform act that is not relevant in this situation. 18 . C. The due care principle states that an individual should react in a situation using the same level of care that would be expected from any reasonable person. It is a very broad standard. The due diligence principle is a more specific component of due care that states that an individual assigned a responsibility should exercise due care to complete it accurately and in a timely manner. 19 . C. The protection of intellectual property is a greater concern during a divestiture, where a subsidiary is being spun off into a separate organization, than an acquisition, where one firm has purchased another. Acquisition concerns include consolidating security functions and policies as well as integrating security tools. 20 . D. Unlike criminal or civil cases, administrative investigations are an internal matter, and there is no set standard of proof that Kelly must apply. However, it would still be wise for her organization to include a standard burden of proof in their own internal procedures to ensure the thoroughness and fairness of investigations. 21 . A. Patents and trade secrets can both protect intellectual property related to a manufacturing process. Trade secrets are appropriate only when the details can be tightly controlled within an organization, so a patent is the appropriate solution in this case. Copyrights are used to protect creative works, while trademarks are used to protect names, logos, and symbols. 22 . B. RAID technology provides fault tolerance for hard drive failures and is an example of a business continuity action. Restoring from backup tapes, relocating to a cold site, and restarting business operations are all disaster recovery actions. 23 . C. After developing a list of assets, the business impact analysis team should assign values to each asset. The other activities listed here occur only after the assets are assigned values. 24 . C. Risk mitigation strategies attempt to lower the probability and/or impact of a risk occurring. Intrusion prevention systems attempt to reduce the probability of a successful attack and are, therefore, examples of risk mitigation. Risk acceptance involves making a conscious decision to accept a risk as is with no further action. Risk avoidance alters business activities to make a risk irrelevant. Risk transference shifts the costs of a risk to another organization, such as an insurance company. 25 . C. A security controls assessment (SCA) most often refers to a formal U.S. government process for assessing security controls. This means that Laura is probably part of a government organization or contractor. 26 . C. There are two steps to answering this question. First, you must realize that for the case to lead to imprisonment, it must be the result of a criminal investigation. Next, you must know that the standard of proof for a criminal investigation is normally the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. 27 . D. Trademark protection extends to words and symbols used to represent an organization, product, or service in the marketplace. Copyrights are used to protect creative works. Patents and trade secrets are used to protect inventions and similar intellectual property. 28 . A. The message displayed is an example of ransomware, which encrypts the contents of a user's computer to prevent legitimate use. This is an example of an availability attack. There is no indication that the data was disclosed to others, so there is no confidentiality/disclosure risk. There is also no indication that other systems were involved in a distributed attack. 29 . B. A health and fitness application developer would not necessarily be collecting or processing healthcare data, and the terms of HIPAA do not apply to this category of business. HIPAA regulates three types of entities— healthcare providers, health information clearinghouses, and health insurance plans—as well as the business associates of any of those covered entities. 30 . A. A SYN flood attack is an example of a denial-of-service attack, which jeopardizes the availability of a targeted network. SYN flood attacks do not target integrity or confidentiality. While this is a denial-of-service attack, denial is not the correct answer because you are asked which principle is being violated, not what type of attack took place. Denial-of-service attacks target resource availability. 31 . D. Strategic plans have a long-term planning horizon of up to five years in most cases. They are designed to strategically align the security function with the business' objectives. Operational and tactical plans have shorter horizons of a year or less. 32 . A. First, you must realize that a trademark is the correct intellectual property protection mechanism for a logo. Therefore, Gina should contact the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which bears responsibility for the registration of trademarks. The Library of Congress Copyright Office administers the copyright program. The National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) play no role in intellectual property protection. 33 . B. When following the segregation of duties principle, organizations divide critical tasks into discrete components and ensure that no one individual has the ability to perform both actions. This prevents a single rogue individual from performing that task in an unauthorized manner. Mandatory vacations and job rotations are designed to detect fraud, not prevent it. Defense in depth is not a relevant principle here because the answer is seeking an initial control. Management may choose to add additional controls at a later date, but the primary objective here would be to implement segregation of duties. 34 . B. The U.S. Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) applies to federal government agencies and contractors. Of the entities listed, a defense contractor is the most likely to have government contracts subject to FISMA. 127/220 35 . B. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) governs the storage, processing, and transmission of payment card information. Among other things, the Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Act regulates the financial reporting activities of publicly traded companies. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulates the handling of protected health information (PHI). The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) regulates the handling of personal financial information. 36 . A. The data custodian role is assigned to an individual who is responsible for implementing the security controls defined by policy and senior management. The data owner does bear ultimate responsibility for these tasks, but the data owner is typically a senior leader who delegates operational responsibility to a data custodian. 37 . B. Written works, such as website content, are normally protected by copyright law. Trade secret status would not be appropriate here because the content is online and available outside the company. Patents protect inventions, and trademarks protect words and symbols used to represent a brand, neither of which is relevant in this scenario. 38 . C. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) contains the text of all administrative laws promulgated by federal agencies. The U.S. Code contains criminal and civil law. Supreme Court rulings contain interpretations of law and are not laws themselves. The Compendium of Laws does not exist. 39 . D. Installing a device that will block attacks is an attempt to lower risk by reducing the likelihood of a successful application attack. Adding a firewall will not address the impact of a risk, the recovery point objective (RPO), or the maximum tolerable outage (MTO). 40 . B. The owner of information security programs may be different from the individuals responsible for implementing the controls. This person should be as senior an individual as possible who is able to focus on the management of the security program. The president and CEO would not be an appropriate choice because an executive at this level is unlikely to have the time necessary to focus on security. Of the remaining choices, the CIO is the most senior position who would be the strongest advocate at the executive level. 41 . A. Senior managers play several business continuity planning roles. These include setting priorities, obtaining resources, and arbitrating disputes among team members. 42 . D. The System and Organization Controls audit program includes business continuity controls in a SOC 2, but not SOC 1, audit. Although FISMA and PCI DSS may audit business continuity, they would not apply to an email service used by a hospital. 43 . A. Repudiation threats allow an attacker to deny having performed an action or activity without the other party being able to prove differently. There is no evidence that the attacker engaged in information disclosure, tampering, or elevation of privilege. 44 . A. Integrity controls, such as the one Beth is implementing in this example, are designed to prevent the unauthorized modification of information. There is no evidence of an attack against availability or confidentiality. Denial is an objective of attackers, rather than of security professionals, and is not relevant in this scenario that targets integrity. 45 . A. SLAs do not normally address issues of data confidentiality. Those provisions are normally included in a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). 46 . A. Trademarks protect words and images that represent a product or service and would not protect computer software. 47 . B. Virtual private networks (VPNs) provide secure communications channels over otherwise insecure networks (such as the Internet) using encryption. If you establish a VPN connection between the two offices, users in one office could securely access content located on the other office's server over the Internet. Digital signatures are used to provide nonrepudiation, not confidentiality. Virtual LANs (VLANs) provide network segmentation on local networks but do not cross the Internet. Digital content management solutions are designed to manage web content, not access shared files located on a file server. 48 . C. RAID uses additional hard drives to protect the server against the failure of a single drive or two, based on the RAID level selected. Load balancing and server clustering do add robustness but require the addition of a server. Scheduled backups protect against data loss but do not provide immediate access to data in the event of a hard drive failure. 49 . A. Hashing allows you to computationally verify that a file has not been modified between hash evaluations. ACLs and read-only attributes are useful controls that may help you prevent unauthorized modification, but they cannot verify that files were not modified. Firewalls are network security controls and do not verify file integrity. 50 . D. Signing a noncompete (NCA) or NDA agreement is typically done at hiring. Exit interviews, recovery of organizational property, and account termination are all common elements of a termination process. During the exit interview, the team may choose to review employment agreements and policies that remain in force, such as a noncompete or nondisclosure agreement. 51 . A. Business continuity plan documentation normally includes the continuity planning goals, a statement of importance, a statement of priorities, a statement of organizational responsibility, a statement of urgency and timing, risk assessment and risk acceptance and mitigation documentation, a vital records program, emergency response guidelines, and documentation for maintaining and testing the plan. 52 . D. Mandatory vacation programs require that employees take continuous periods of time off each year and have their system privileges revoked during that time. The purpose of these required vacation periods is to disrupt any attempt to engage in the cover-up actions necessary to hide fraud and result in exposing the threat. Separation of duties, least privilege, and defense in depth all may help prevent the fraud in the first place but are unlikely to speed the detection of fraud that has already occurred. 53 . C. The Risk Maturity Model (RMM) is specifically designed for the purpose of assessing enterprise risk management programs. Jeff could conceivably use the more generic capability maturity model (CMM), but this would not be as good of a fit. The software capability maturity model (SW-CMM) is designed for assessing development projects, not risk management efforts. The Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT) are a set of security control objectives and not a maturity model. 54 . C. Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks try to disrupt the availability of information systems and networks by flooding a victim with traffic or otherwise disrupting service. 55 . B. Baselines provide the minimum level of security that every system throughout the organization must meet. 128/220 This type of information would not appear in a policy, guideline, or procedure. 56 . C. Everyone in the organization should receive basic training on the nature and scope of the business continuity program. Those with specific roles, such as first responders and senior executives, should also receive detailed, role-specific training. 57 . C. If the organization's primary concern is the cost of rebuilding the data center, James should use the replacement cost method to determine the current market price for equivalent servers. 58 . C. PCI DSS is a standard promulgated by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) but is enforced through contractual relationships between merchants and their banks. Therefore, the bank would be the appropriate entity to initiate an investigation under PCI DSS. Local and federal law enforcement agencies (such as the FBI) could decide to pursue a criminal investigation if the circumstances warrant it, but they do not have the authority to enforce PCI DSS requirements. 59 . A. This is an example of a security champion program that uses individuals employed in other roles in a business unit to share security messaging. The individuals in these roles are not necessarily security experts and do not have a peer review role. 60 . A. Keyloggers monitor the keystrokes of an individual and report them back to an attacker. They are designed to steal sensitive information, a disruption of the goal of confidentiality. 61 . B. The most appropriate standard to use as a baseline when evaluating vendors is to determine whether the vendor's security controls meet the organization's own standards. Compliance with laws and regulations should be included in that requirement and are a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for working with the vendor. Vendor compliance with their own policies also fits into the category of necessary, but not sufficient, controls, as the vendor's policy may be weaker than the organization's own requirements. The elimination of all identified security risks is an impossible requirement for a potential vendor to meet. 62 . A. The missing step of the NIST risk management framework is assessing security controls. This is an important component of the process. The organization has already prepared, categorized the system, selected appropriate controls, and implemented those controls. Before authorizing the use of the system, they must assess the effectiveness of those controls to ensure that they meet security requirements. 63 . D. HAL Systems decided to stop offering the service because of the risk. This is an example of a risk avoidance strategy. The company altered its operations in a manner that eliminates the risk of NTP misuse. Risk acceptance involves making a conscious decision to accept a risk as is with no further action. Risk mitigation takes measures to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of a risk. Risk transfer shifts the costs of a risk to another organization, such as an insurance company. 64 . C. Confidentiality controls prevent the disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals. Limiting the likelihood of a data breach is an attempt to prevent unauthorized disclosure. 65 . A. The emergency response guidelines should include the immediate steps an organization should follow in response to an emergency situation. These include immediate response procedures, a list of individuals who should be notified of the emergency, and secondary response procedures for first responders. They do not include long-term actions such as activating business continuity protocols, ordering equipment, or activating DR sites. 66 . B. Although the CEO will not normally serve on a BCP team, it is best to obtain top-level management approval for your plan to increase the likelihood of successful adoption. 67 . D. The project scope and planning phase includes four actions: a structured analysis of the organization, the creation of a BCP team, an assessment of available resources, and an analysis of the legal and regulatory landscape. 68 . D. Keeping a service up and running is an example of an availability control because it increases the likelihood that a service will remain available to answer user requests. 69 . A. A cold site includes the basic capabilities required for data center operations such as space, power, HVAC, and communications, but it does not include any of the hardware required to restore operations. Warm sites, hot sites, and mobile sites would all include hardware. 70 . B. In general, companies should be aware of the breach laws in any location where they do business. U.S. states have a diverse collection of breach laws and requirements, meaning that in this case, Greg's company may need to review many different breach laws to determine which they may need to comply with if they conduct business in the state or with the state's residents. 71 . B. ISO 27002 is an international standard focused on information security and titled “Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection: Information security controls.” ITIL does contain security management practices, but it is not the sole focus of the document, and the ITIL security section is derived from ISO 27002. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is focused on software development, and the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide focuses on project management. 72 . B. The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires that all communications carriers make wiretaps possible for law enforcement officials who have an appropriate court order. 73 . B. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) places strict privacy regulations on financial institutions, including providing written notice of privacy practices to customers. 74 . C. Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) typically require either mutual or one-way confidentiality in a business relationship. Service-level agreements specify service uptime and other performance measures. Noncompete agreements (NCAs) limit the future employment possibilities of employees. Recovery time objectives (RTOs) are used in business continuity planning. 75 . B. The ISC2 Code of Ethics also includes “Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally” but does not specifically require credential holders to disclose all breaches of privacy, trust, or ethics. 76 . C. While senior management should be represented on the BCP team, it would be highly unusual for the CEO to fill this role personally. 77 . D. Nonrepudiation allows a recipient to prove to a third party that a message came from a purported source. Authentication would provide proof to Ben that the sender was authentic, but Ben would not be able to prove this to a third party. 78 . C. Defense in depth states that organizations should have overlapping security controls designed to meet the same security objectives whenever possible. This approach provides security in the event of a single control 129/220 failure. Least privilege ensures that an individual has only the minimum set of permissions necessary to carry out their assigned job functions and does not require overlapping controls. Separation of duties requires that one person not have permission to perform two separate actions that, when combined, carry out a sensitive function. Security through obscurity attempts to hide the details of security controls to add security to them. Neither separation of duties nor security through obscurity involves overlapping controls. 79 . A, B. All ISC2 certified professionals are required to comply with the ISC2 Code of Ethics. All employees of an organization are required to comply with the organization's code of ethics. The federal code of ethics (or, more formally, the Code of Ethics for Government Service) would not apply to a nonprofit organization, as it applies only to federal employees. RFC 1087 does provide a code of ethics for the Internet, but it is not binding on any individual. 80 . B. Ben should encrypt the data to provide an additional layer of protection as a compensating control. The organization has already made a policy exception, so he should not react by objecting to the exception or removing the data without authorization. Purchasing insurance may transfer some of the risk but is not a mitigating control. 81 . A. The risk assessment team should pay the most immediate attention to those risks that appear in quadrant I. These are the risks with a high probability of occurring and a high impact on the organization if they do occur. 82 . D. Electronic access to company resources must be carefully coordinated. An employee who retains access after being terminated may use that access to take retaliatory action. On the other hand, if access is terminated too early, the employee may figure out that they are about to be terminated. 83 . D. In a risk acceptance strategy, the organization decides that taking no action is the most beneficial route to managing a risk. 84 . A. COPPA requires that websites obtain advance parental consent for the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. 85 . D. The annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) is the frequency at which you should expect a risk to materialize each year. In a 100-year flood plain, risk analysts expect a flood to occur once every 100 years, or 0.01 times per year. 86 . D. Wireshark is a protocol analyzer and may be used to eavesdrop on network connections. Eavesdropping is an attack against confidentiality. 87 . C. In reduction analysis, the security professional breaks the system down into five core elements: trust boundaries, data flow paths, input points, privileged operations, and details about security controls. 88 . D. South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) governs the processing of personal data and would affect any new enterprise operating within its jurisdiction that handles personal information. PIPL refers to China's Personal Information Protection Law, which would not apply in South Africa. PCI DSS is a set of security standards for entities that handle credit cards and does not relate to privacy law but rather to the security of cardholder data. PIPEDA, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, is Canada's data privacy law and would not be applicable to operations in South Africa. 89 . B. Qualitative tools are often used in business impact assessment to capture the impact on intangible factors such as customer confidence, employee morale, and reputation. 90 . C. Risks are the combination of a threat and a vulnerability. Threats are the external forces seeking to undermine security, such as the malicious hacker in this case. Vulnerabilities are the internal weaknesses that might allow a threat to succeed. In this scenario the missing patch is the vulnerability, and the malicious hacker is the threat. If the hacker (threat) attempts a SQL injection attack against the unpatched server (vulnerability), the result is website defacement. 91 . C. The exposure factor is the percentage of the facility that risk managers expect will be damaged if a risk materializes. It is calculated by dividing the amount of damage by the asset value. In this case, that is $5 million in damage divided by the $10 million facility value, or 50%. 92 . B. The annualized rate of occurrence is the number of times that risk analysts expect a risk to happen in any given year. In this case, the analysts expect tornados once every 200 years, or 0.005 times per year. 93 . A. The annualized loss expectancy is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). In this case, the SLE is $5,000,000, and the ARO is 0.005. Multiplying these numbers together gives you the ALE of $25,000. 94 . C. Information disclosure attacks rely upon the revelation of private, confidential, or controlled information. When the attacker examined the HTML code and discovered sensitive information, this was an example of an information disclosure attack, as the attacker gained information they should not have been privy to. 95 . A. Supply chain management can help ensure the security of hardware, software, and services that an organization acquires. Chris should focus on each step that his laptops take from the original equipment manufacturer to delivery. 96 . C. Change management is a critical control process that involves systematically managing change. Without it, Lisa might simply deploy her code to production without oversight, documentation, or testing. Regression testing focuses on testing to ensure that new code doesn't bring back old flaws, while fuzz testing feeds unexpected input to code. In a code review the source code itself is reviewed, and this may be done as part of the change management process but isn't what is described here. 97 . A. Charles is tracking a key performance indicator (KPI). A KPI is used to measure performance (and success). Without a definition of success, this would simply be a metric, but Charles is working toward a known goal and can measure against it. There is not a return investment calculation in this problem, and the measure is not a control. 98 . D. A fitness evaluation is not a typical part of a hiring process. Drug tests, background checks, and social media checks are all common parts of current hiring practices. 99 . A, C. Supply chain risks occur when the adversary is interfering with the delivery of goods or services from a supplier to the customer. This might involve tampering with hardware before the customer receives it or using social engineering to compromise a vendor employee. Hacking into a web server run in an infrastructure-as-aservice (IaaS) environment is not a supply chain risk because the web server is already under the control of the 130/220 customer. Using a botnet to conduct a denial-of-service attack does not involve any supply chain elements. 100 . The laws or industry standards match to the descriptions as follows: 1 . GLBA: A. A U.S. law that requires covered financial institutions to provide their customers with a privacy notice on a yearly basis 2 . PCI DSS: C. An industry standard that covers organizations that handle payment cards 3 . HIPAA: D. A U.S. law that provides data privacy and security requirements for medical information 4 . SOX: B. A U.S. law that requires internal controls’ assessments including IT transaction flows for publicly traded companies Chapter 2: Asset Security (Domain 2) 1 . A. Scoping is the process of determining which controls are appropriate to an organization, environment, or implementation. Bounds checking is the process of making sure that data does not overflow a variable. Data stewards provide oversight and data governance. Tailoring modifies controls to fit a specific situation or need. 2 . A. Business owners have to balance the need to provide value with regulatory, security, and other requirements. This makes the adoption of a common framework like COBIT attractive. Data owners are more likely to ask that those responsible for control selection identify a standard to use. Data processors are required to perform specific actions under regulations like the EU GDPR. Finally, in many organizations, data stewards are internal roles that oversee how data is used. 3 . B. The best option for Nadia is a cloud access security broker (CASB). A CASB is designed to sit between a cloud environment and the users who use it, and it provides monitoring and policy enforcement capabilities. A next-generation firewall (NGFW), an intrusion detection system (IDS), and a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) tool could each provide some insight into what is going on, but they are not purpose built and designed for this like the CASB is. The NGFW and IDS are most likely to provide insight into traffic patterns and behaviors, while the SOAR is primarily intended to monitor other systems and centralize data for response, making it potentially the least useful in this specific scenario. 4 . B. Media is typically labeled with the highest classification level of data it contains. This prevents the data from being handled or accessed at a lower classification level. Data integrity requirements may be part of a classification process but don't independently drive labeling in a classification scheme. 5 . A. The need to protect sensitive data drives data classification. Classifying data allows organizations to focus on data that needs to be protected rather than spending effort on less important data. Remanence describes data left on media after an attempt is made to remove the data. Transmitting data isn't a driver for an administrative process to protect sensitive data, and clearing is a technical process for removing data from media. 6 . A. A data retention policy can help to ensure that outdated data is purged, removing potential additional costs for discovery. Many organizations have aggressive retention policies to both reduce the cost of storage and limit the amount of data that is kept on hand and discoverable. Data retention policies are not designed to destroy incriminating data, and legal requirements for data retention must still be met. 7 . D. Custodians are delegated the role of handling day-to-day tasks by managing and overseeing how data is handled, stored, and protected. Data processors are systems used to process data. Business owners are typically project or system owners who are tasked with making sure systems provide value to their users or customers. 8 . C. In a typical data life cycle, collection is the first stage, although some may replace collection with creation. Once collected, data can be analyzed, used, stored, and disposed of at the end of its useful life. Policies may be created at any time, and organizations often have data before they have policies. Labels are added to data during the analysis, usage, or retention cycle. 9 . C. Security baselines provide a starting point to scope and tailor security controls to your organization's needs. They aren't always appropriate to specific organizational needs, they cannot ensure that systems are always in a secure state, and they do not prevent liability. 10 . A. Clearing describes preparing media for reuse. When media is cleared, unclassified data is written over all addressable locations on the media. Once that's completed, the media can be reused, although it may be possible to retrieve some of the original data using retrieval tools. Erasing is the deletion of files or media and may not include all of the data on the device or media, making it the worst choice here. Purging is a more intensive form of clearing for reuse in lower-security areas, and sanitization is a series of processes that removes data from a system or media while ensuring that the data is unrecoverable by any means. 11 . B. Sensitive data scanning tools are designed to scan for and flag sensitive data types using known formatting and structure. Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and other regularly structured data that follows known rules can be identified and then addressed as needed. Manual searching is a massive undertaking for an organization with even a relatively small amount of data; asset metadata needs to be set first and would have already been identified; and a SOAR is used to automate incident response and orchestrate security actions. 12 . D. Spare sectors, bad sectors, and space provided for wear leveling on SSDs (overprovisioned space) may all contain data that was written to the space that will not be cleared when the drive is wiped. This is a form of data remanence and is a concern for organizations that do not want data to potentially be accessible. Many wiping utilities deal only with currently addressable space on the drive. SSDs cannot be degaussed, and wear leveling space cannot be reliably used to hide data. These spaces are still addressable by the drive, although they may not be seen by the operating system. 13 . C. Commercial data classification often takes into account the value of the data, any regulatory or legal requirements that may apply to the data, and how long the data is useful—its life span. The impact to national security is more typically associated with government classification schemes. 14 . C. Data is often considered based on the data state that it is in. Data can be at rest (on a drive or other storage medium), in use and thus in memory or a buffer and often decrypted for use, or in transit over a network. Data that is resident in system memory is considered data in use. 15 . C. A watermark is used to digitally label data and can be used to indicate ownership, as well as to assist a digital rights management (DRM) system in identifying data that should be protected. Encryption would have prevented the data from being accessed if it was lost, while classification is part of the set of security practices that can help make sure the right controls are in place. Finally, metadata is used to label data and might help a 131/220 data loss prevention system flag it before it leaves your organization. 16 . B. AES is a strong modern symmetric encryption algorithm that is appropriate for encrypting data at rest. TLS is frequently used to secure data when it is in transit. A virtual private network is not necessarily an encrypted connection and would be used for data in motion, while DES is an outdated algorithm and should not be used for data that needs strong security. 17 . A. Data loss prevention (DLP) systems can use labels on data to determine the appropriate controls to apply to the data. Most DLP systems won't modify labels in real time and typically don't work directly with firewalls to stop traffic. Deleting unlabeled data would cause big problems for organizations that haven't labeled every piece of data! 18 . B. The value of the data contained on media often exceeds the cost of the media, making more expensive media that may have a longer life span or additional capabilities like encryption support a good choice. While expensive media may be less likely to fail, the reason it makes sense is the value of the data, not just that it is less likely to fail. In general, the cost of the media doesn't have anything to do with the ease of encryption, and data integrity isn't ensured by better media. 19 . D. Destruction is the most complete method of ensuring that data cannot be exposed, and organizations often opt to destroy either the drive or the entire workstation or device to ensure that data cannot be recovered or exposed. Sanitization is a combination of processes that ensure that data from a system cannot be recovered by any means. Erasing and clearing are both prone to mistakes and technical problems that can result in remnant data and don't make sense for systems that handle proprietary information. 20 . D. Common practice makes proprietary or confidential data the most sensitive data. Private data is internal business data that shouldn't be exposed but that doesn't meet the threshold for confidential or proprietary data. Sensitive data may help attackers or otherwise create risk and typically refers to any information that isn't public or unclassified, and public data is just that—data that is or can be made public. 21 . C. Data at rest is inactive data that is physically stored. Data in an IPsec tunnel or part of an e-commerce transaction is data in motion. Data in RAM is ephemeral and is not inactive. 22 . C. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) provides the set of requirements for credit card processing systems. The Microsoft, NSA, and CIS baseline are all useful for building a Windows 11 security standard, but the PCI DSS standard is a better answer. 23 . D. The CIS benchmarks are an example of a security baseline. A risk assessment would help identify which controls were needed, and proper system ownership is an important part of making sure baselines are implemented and maintained. Data labeling can help ensure that controls are applied to the right systems and data. 24 . B. Scoping involves selecting only the controls that are appropriate for your IT systems, while tailoring matches your organization's mission and the controls from a selected baseline. Baselining is the process of configuring a system or software to match a baseline or building a baseline itself. Selection isn't a technical term used for any of these processes. 25 . B. The controls implemented from a security baseline should match the data classification of the data used or stored on the system. Custodians are trusted to ensure the day-to-day security of the data and should do so by ensuring that the baseline is met and maintained. Business owners often have a conflict of interest between functionality and data security, and of course, applying the same controls everywhere is expensive and may not meet business needs or be a responsible use of resources. 26 . D. The third-party company is a data processor—they process data on behalf of Henry's company, which is a data controller. The data is collected about data subjects. Data owners are tasked with making decisions about data, such as who receives access to it and how it is used. 27 . B. Many organizations require the destruction of media that contains data at higher levels of classification. Often the cost of the media is lower than the potential costs of data exposure, and it is difficult to guarantee that reused media doesn't contain remnant data. Tapes can be erased by degaussing, but degaussing is not always fully effective. Bitrot describes the slow loss of data on aging media, while data permanence is a term sometimes used to describe the life span of data and media. 28 . A. NIST Special Publication 800-122 defines PII as any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, Social Security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, biometric records, and other information that is linked or linkable to an individual such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. PHI is health-related information about a specific person, Social Security numbers are issued to individuals in the United States, and SII is a made-up term. 29 . B. Typically, data breaches cause the greatest reputational damage as a result of threats to data at rest. Data at rest with a high level of sensitivity is often encrypted to help prevent this. Decryption is not as significant of a threat if strong encryption is used and encryption keys are well secured. Insider threats are a risk, but the majority of insider threat issues are unintentional rather than intentional, making this risk less likely in most organizations. 30 . B. Full disk encryption only protects data at rest. Since it encrypts the full disk, it does not distinguish between labeled and unlabeled data. 31 . C. This is an example of an end-of-support (EOS) scenario. The company is intentionally ending support and needs to address what happens to the devices next—secure disposal, destruction, or re-sale—depending on data security requirements and policies set by the company. EOL is when a device or software is no longer made or supported, in contrast to end of support, which may be when it is no longer serviced, including via patches, upgrades, or organizational maintenance. Planned obsolescence and device risk management are not terms that are used on the exam. 32 . D. Classification identifies the value of data to an organization. This can often help drive IT expenditure prioritization and could help with rough cost estimates if a breach occurred, but that's not the primary purpose. Finally, most breach laws call out specific data types for notification rather than requiring organizations to classify data themselves. 33 . B. Downgrading systems and media is rare due to the difficulty of ensuring that sanitization is complete. The need to completely wipe (or destroy) the media that systems use means that the cost of reuse is often significant and may exceed the cost of purchasing a new system or media. The goal of purging is to ensure that no data remains, so commingling data should not be a concern, nor should the exposure of the data; only staff with the proper clearance should handle the systems! Finally, a DLP system should flag data based on labels, not on the system it comes from. 132/220 34 . A. Classification should be conducted based on the value of the data to the organization, its sensitivity, and the amount of harm that could result from exposure of the data. Cost should be considered when implementing controls and is weighed against the damage that exposure would create. 35 . C. Erasing, which describes a typical deletion process in many operating systems, typically removes only the link to the file and leaves the data that makes up the file itself. The data will remain in place but not indexed until the space is needed and it is overwritten. Degaussing works only on magnetic media, but it can be quite effective on it. Purging and clearing both describe more elaborate removal processes. 36 . C. TLS is a modern encryption method used to encrypt and protect data in transit. BitLocker is a full-disk encryption technology used for data at rest. DES and SSL are both outdated encryption methods and should not be used for data that requires high levels of security. 37 . C. We know that the data classification will not be the top-level classification of Confidential because the loss of the data would not cause severe damage and is not medical data covered by HIPAA. This means we have to choose between private (PHI) and sensitive (confidential). Calling this private due to the patient's personally identifiable information fits the classification scheme, giving us the correct answer. 38 . A. A data loss prevention (DLP) system or software is designed to identify labeled data or data that fits specific patterns and descriptions to help prevent it from leaving the organization. An IDS is designed to identify intrusions. Although some IDS systems can detect specific types of sensitive data using pattern matching, they have no ability to stop traffic. A firewall uses rules to control traffic routing, while UDP is a network protocol. 39 . A. When data is stored in a mixed classification environment, it is typically classified based on the highest classification of data included. In this case, the U.S. government's highest classification is Top Secret. Mixed classification is not a valid classification in this scheme. 40 . B. The end of support of a device or product typically occurs after the end of life and end of sales. Support may continue for a period of months or even years, but eventually support stops too. General availability is found during the main part of a life cycle, rather than at the end, and helps note when the product is out of testing and can be acquired or used by customers or others instead of specific groups like beta testers or early release partners. 41 . D. Tailoring ensures that assessment methods are appropriate to the systems, services, and other assets that are being validated and is the best answer here. Scoping is a related term and involves setting the boundaries of security control implementations. Asset management involves how assets are overseen throughout their life cycle, and compliance is a broad term that describes ensuring that regulations, contractual terms, or other requirements are met. 42 . B. Group Policy provides the ability to monitor and apply settings in a security baseline. Manual checks by users and using start-up scripts provide fewer reviews and may be prone to failure, while periodic review of the baseline won't result in compliance being checked. 43 . B. Providing consent, or agreeing to data collection and use, is important in many data collection scenarios and may be required by law. Remanence occurs when data remains in place, sometimes inadvertently, after it should have been removed or disposed of. Retention is the intentional process of keeping and managing data. Certification is not a data life-cycle process element. 44 . A. Amy is a data custodian and is responsible for the technical environment, including things like database structures and the technical implementations of data policies. Some organizations may overlap other data roles, including data controllers or data stewards, but the best answer here is a data custodian. Amy is not a data user and is not a data processor who uses the data on behalf of a data controller. 45 . B. A data loss prevention (DLP) system can tag, monitor, and limit where files are transferred to. Jim's company may also elect to use digital rights management tools in combination with a data loss prevention system, but DRM controls how data can be used, not where files are transferred to or where they exist at any point in time in most cases. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) may be able to detect files that are being sent across a network but won't stop files from being copied on workstations or thumb drives. Antivirus is not designed for this purpose. 46 . D. Using strong encryption, like AES-256, can help ensure that loss of removable media like tapes doesn't result in a data breach. Security labels may help with handling processes, but they won't help once the media is stolen or lost. Having multiple copies will ensure that you can still access the data but won't increase the security of the media. Finally, using hard drives instead of tape only changes the media type and not the risk from theft or loss. 47 . D. Electronic signatures, as used in this rule, prove that the signature was provided by the intended signer. Electronic signatures as part of the FDA code are intended to ensure that electronic records are “trustworthy, reliable, and generally equivalent to paper records and handwritten signatures executed on paper.” Signatures cannot provide confidentiality or integrity and don't ensure that someone has reviewed the data. 48 . D. Tags that include information about the life span of the data and when it has expired can help with life-cycle management processes, part of data maintenance for organizations. Tags can be as simple as timestamps, or they can include additional metadata like the data type, creator, or purpose that can help inform the retention and disposal process. Rotation of files like logs is commonly done to limit how much space they take up, but rotation itself does not address disposal requirements and information that would guide the disposal process. DRM, or digital rights management, and DLP, or data loss prevention, both address data security and use but not disposal. 49 . B. During the data maintenance phase of a typical data life cycle, activities like data scrubbing occur to remove unneeded, incorrect, or out-of-date data. Data retention is not a phase; instead, it is a decision that organizations make based on requirements, laws, or their own needs. Data remanence is also not a phase. Data remanence describes the problem of data that remains after data is removed. Finally, in the data collection phase, data is acquired and may be scrubbed, but the question describes a process occurring after data is no longer needed, not during acquisition. 50 . B. Asset tagging is used to make sure that individuals working with assets can determine the security level or practices they require. Tailoring adjusts security requirements to organizational needs. Other controls, such as sanitization and encryption, may be required by a specific asset classification but are not sufficient to meet a full range of security requirements. 51 . C. Data labels are crucial to identify the classification level of information contained on the media, and labeling data at creation helps to ensure that it is properly handled throughout its life cycle. Digital rights management (DRM) tools provide ways to control how data is used, while encrypting it can help maintain the confidentiality 133/220 and integrity of the data. Classifying the data is necessary to label it, but it doesn't automatically place a label on the data. 52 . D. The NIST SP 800-88 process for sanitization and disposition shows that media that will be reused and was classified at a moderate level should be purged and then that purge should be validated. Finally, it should be documented. 53 . D. Data in transit is data that is traversing a network or is otherwise in motion. TLS, VPNs, and IPsec tunnels are all techniques used to protect data in transit. AES, Serpent, and IDEA are all symmetric algorithms, while Telnet, ISDN, and UDP are all protocols. BitLocker and FileVault are both used to encrypt data, but they protect only stored data, not data in transit. 54 . C. The data owner has ultimate responsibility for data belonging to an organization and is typically the CEO, president, or another senior employee. Business and mission owners typically own processes or programs. System owners own a system that processes sensitive data. 55 . C. The most difficult location to secure for encryption keys and similar highly sensitive information is in active memory because the data needs to be decrypted to be used. When data is at rest on a drive or in transit via either a local or public network, it can be encrypted until it reaches its destination, and you can use strong encryption in each of those circumstances. 56 . A. Chris is most likely to be responsible for classifying the data that he owns as well as assisting with or advising the system owners on security requirements and control selection. In an organization with multiple data owners, Chris is unlikely to set criteria for classifying data on his own. As a data owner, Chris will also not typically have direct responsibility for scoping, tailoring, applying, or enforcing those controls. 57 . B. The system administrators are acting in the roles of data administrators who grant access and will also act as custodians who are tasked with the day-to-day application of security controls. They are not acting as data owners who own the data itself. Typically, system administrators are delegated authority by system owners, such as a department head, and of course they are tasked with providing access to users. 58 . C. Third-party organizations that process personal data on behalf of a data controller are known as data processors. The organization that they are contracting with would act in the role of the business or mission owners, and others within Chris's organization would have the role of data administrators, granting access as needed to the data based on their operational procedures and data classification. 59 . D. While it can be a lot of work, the most complete inventory of active systems and devices can be created by determining what is connected to the network and then finding those assets. Port scans can help to find some systems, but firewalls and other security solutions can prevent systems from being discovered. Staff may not know about all of the systems and devices on the network or may presume that someone else will provide information about shared resources such as printers, security cameras, or other devices. Active Directory is unlikely to contain all devices, particularly if an inventory is needed! 60 . B. In most organizations, changing processes so that new systems and devices are added to inventory before they are deployed is the first step in making sure asset inventories are current. Yearly or quarterly updates are too infrequent for most organizations and will lead to gaps as devices are forgotten. 61 . C. Eric should use metadata tagging to allow him to use technical tools like DLP and DRM to handle and track data based on its type and content. File extensions do not reveal data security or type, and relying on network share locations to secure data or inventory will lead to gaps in security as files are moved, copied, or stored locally. 62 . D. Patents, databases, and formulas are all examples of intangible assets. Tangible assets include things like hardware, cables, and buildings. Personnel assets include employees, and most organizations would be quite concerned if their employees were intangible! 63 . D. There is no requirement that data collection be equal or equivalent. Instead, data collection statutes and other requirements often require that only required data is collected, that individuals are made aware of the data collection, and that they consent to the collection. Similarly, data should be collected only lawfully and via fair methods. 64 . B. Requiring all media to have a label means that when unlabeled media is found, it should immediately be considered suspicious. This helps to prevent mistakes that might leave sensitive data unlabeled. Prelabeled media is not necessarily cheaper (nor may it make sense to buy!), while reusing public media simply means that it must be classified based on the data it now contains. HIPAA does not have specific media labeling requirements. 65 . B. Data in use is data that is in a temporary storage location while an application or process is using it. Thus, data in memory is best described as data in use or ephemeral data. Data at rest is in storage, while data in transit is traveling over a network or other channel. Data at large is a made-up term. 66 . C. Validation processes are conducted to ensure that the sanitization process was completed, avoiding data remanence. A form like this one helps to ensure that each device has been checked and that it was properly wiped, purged, or sanitized. This can allow reuse, does not prevent destruction, and does not help with attribution, which is a concept used with encryption to prove who created or sent a file. 67 . C. Ensuring that data cannot be recovered is difficult, and the time and effort required to securely and completely wipe media as part of declassification can exceed the cost of new media. Sanitization, purging, and clearing may be part of declassification, but they are not reasons that it is not frequently chosen as an option for organizations with data security concerns. 68 . D. Destruction is the final stage in the life cycle of media and can be done via disintegration, incineration, or a variety of other methods that result in the media and data being nonrecoverable. Sanitization is a combination of processes used when data is being removed from a system or media. Purging is an intense form of clearing, and degaussing uses strong magnetic fields to wipe data from magnetic media. 69 . A. PHI is protected health information. Personally identifiable information (PII) is any information that can identify an individual. Proprietary data is information that helps organizations maintain a competitive edge or that they want to keep to their own organization or a controlled set of individuals. PID is not a term used for data classification. 70 . D. Handling requirements and tools include visual indicators like a distinctive screen background and can help employees remember what level of classification they are dealing with and thus the handling requirements that they are expected to follow. 71 . C. If an organization allows media to be downgraded, the purging process should be followed, and then the media should be relabeled. Degaussing may be used for magnetic media but won't handle all types of media. 134/220 Pulverizing would destroy the media, preventing reuse, while relabeling first could lead to mistakes that result in media that hasn't been purged entering use. 72 . B. The data owner sets the rules for use and protection of data. The remaining options all describe tasks for the system owner, including implementation of security controls. 73 . B. In the NIST SP 800-60 diagram, the process determines appropriate categorization levels resulting in security categorization and then uses that as an input to determine controls. Standard selection would occur at an organizational level, while baselining occurs when systems are configured to meet a baseline. Sanitization would require the intentional removal of data from machines or media. 74 . C. A and E can both be expected to have data at rest. C, the Internet, is an unknown, and the data can't be guaranteed to be at rest. B, D, and F are all data in transit across network links. 75 . C. B, D, and F all show network links. Of the answers provided, Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides the best security for data in motion. AES-256 and 3DES are both symmetric ciphers and are more likely to be used for data at rest. SSL has been replaced with TLS and should not be a preferred solution. 76 . B. Sending a file that is encrypted before it leaves means that exposure of the file in transit will not result in a confidentiality breach, and the file will remain secure until decrypted at location E. Since options A, C, and D do not provide any information about what happens at point C, they should be considered insecure, as the file may be at rest at point C in an unencrypted form. 77 . C. Encrypting and labeling sensitive email will ensure that it remains confidential and can be identified. Performing these actions only on sensitive email will reduce the cost and effort of encrypting all email, allowing only sensitive email to be the focus of the organization's efforts. Only encrypting highly sensitive email not only skips labeling but might expose other classifications of email that shouldn't be exposed. 78 . C. Data retention policies can reduce the number of old logs and other files that may need to be produced during a legal case. That can reduce organizational risk, but retention policies need to be in place well before a legal hold is filed. Reducing storage in use does not reduce liability, but it can reduce financial costs, and data retention policies don't tend to limit the number of classifications in use. Legal penalties are not impacted by a retention policy. 79 . C. Systems used to process data are data processors. Data owners are typically CEOs or other very senior staff, custodians are granted rights to perform day-to-day tasks when handling data, and mission owners are typically program or information system owners. 80 . D. Personally identifiable information includes any information that can uniquely identify an individual. This would include name, Social Security number, and any other unique identifier (including a student ID number). ZIP code, by itself, does not uniquely identify an individual. 81 . B. Protected health information, or PHI, includes a variety of data in multiple formats, including oral and recorded data, such as that created or received by healthcare providers, employers, and life insurance providers. PHI must be protected by HIPAA. PII is personally identifiable information. SHI and HPHI are both made-up acronyms. 82 . B. Tokenization replaces other data with a random string of characters. These tokens are then matched to the actual values for secure lookups as needed. Anonymization removes all personally identifiable data to ensure that the original subject cannot be identified. Data masking obscures some, but not all, data. Pseudonymization uses a pseudonym or alias to replace other information. 83 . B. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI-DSS, is a credit card industry data security standard that defines how businesses must handle information related to credit cards. CC-Comply was made up for this question. GLBA, or Gramm-Leach-Bliley, modernized financial institution standards, and GDPR is an EU data privacy regulation. 84 . C. Due to problems with remnant data, the U.S. National Security Agency requires physical destruction of SSDs. This process, known as disintegration, results in very small fragments via a shredding process. Zero fill wipes a drive by replacing data with zeros, degaussing uses magnets to wipe magnetic media, and clearing is the process of preparing media for reuse. 85 . A. The data owner bears responsibility for categorizing information systems and delegates selection of controls to system owners, while custodians implement the controls. Users don't perform any of these actions, while business owners are tasked with ensuring that systems are fulfilling their business purpose. 86 . B. PCI DSS provides a set of required security controls and standards. Step 2 would be guided by the requirements of PCI DSS. PCI DSS will not greatly influence step 1 because all of the systems handle credit card information, making PCI DSS apply to all systems covered. Steps 3 and 4 will be conducted after PCI DSS has guided the decisions in step 2. 87 . C. Custodians are tasked with the day-to-day monitoring of the integrity and security of data. Step 5 requires monitoring, which is a custodial task. A data owner may grant rights to custodians but will not be responsible for conducting monitoring. Data processors process data on behalf of the data controller, and a user simply uses the data via a computing system. 88 . B. Susan's organization is limiting its risk by sending drives that have been sanitized before they are destroyed. This limits the possibility of a data breach if drives are mishandled by the third party, allowing them to be stolen, resold, or simply copied. The destruction of the drives will handle any issues with data remanence, while classification mistakes are not important if the drives have been destroyed. Wiping the data before destruction does not make a meaningful difference for data retention policy concerns. Data permanence and the life span of the data are not important on a destroyed drive. 89 . C. RFID tags are a common solution for tracking hardware assets and equipment. They can be queried wirelessly at varying ranges depending on the tags and may be built-in to handheld readers or even included in doorways or arches to track items as they enter or leave a facility. Visual inventory relies on staff checking items, MAC addresses are hardware addresses for networked devices, and not every asset in inventory is likely to have a wireless network capability—or to be on! Steganography is hiding messages in images and doesn't help at all with inventory. 90 . D. Record retention is the process of retaining and maintaining information for as long as it is needed. A data storage policy describes how and why data is stored, while data storage is the process of actually keeping the data. Asset maintenance is a noninformation-security-related process for maintaining physical assets. 91 . C. The cost of the data is not directly included in the classification process. Instead, the impact on the organization if the data were exposed or breached is considered. Who can access the data and what regulatory or compliance requirements cover the data are also important considerations. 135/220 92 . B. Symmetric encryption like AES is typically used for data at rest. Asymmetric encryption is often used during transactions or communications when the ability to have public and private keys is necessary. DES is an outdated encryption standard, and OTP is the acronym for onetime password. 93 . D. Administrators have the rights to apply the permissions to access and handle data. Custodians are trusted with day-to-day data handling tasks. Business owners are typically system or project owners, and data processors are systems used to process data. 94 . A. Knowing the asset's owner also tells you who is responsible for protecting the asset or for delegating that task. While asset owners may be law enforcement contacts, this is not a critical item for asset security. It does not directly help you to establish the value of the asset or to set security classification levels for an asset. 95 . A. Tapes may be vulnerable to theft or loss in transit. That means tapes that are leaving their normal storage facility should be handled according to the organization's classification schemes and handling requirements. Purging the tapes would cause the loss of data, while increasing the classification level of the tapes does not align with the standard practices for data classification and handling. The tapes should be encrypted rather than decrypted. 96 . A. The correct answer is the tape that is being shipped to a storage facility. You might think that the tape in shipment is “in motion,” but the concept is that the data is not being accessed and is instead in storage rather than being sent across a network. Data in a TCP packet, in an e-commerce transaction, or in local RAM is in motion and is actively being used. 97 . D. When the value of data changes due to legal, compliance, or business reasons, reviewing classifications and reclassifying the data is an appropriate response. Once the review is complete, data can be reclassified and handled according to its classification level. Simply relabeling the data avoids the classification process and may not result in the data being handled appropriately. Similarly, selecting a new baseline or simply encrypting the data may not handle all of the needs that the changes affecting the data create. 98 . A, B, C. Data owners, controllers, and custodians are typically found inside of a company, while data processors are typically third parties. 99 . C. Public data is just that—information that can be made public without any harm to the organization, and in fact, it is often information that the organization wants to make available. Private information should stay private inside of an organization, sensitive data may cause damage to the mission of the organization if exposed, and proprietary or confidential information is the most sensitive data that an organization wants to protect. 100 . The data elements match with the categories as follows: Data elements 1 . Medical records: B. PHI 2 . Trade secrets A. Proprietary data 3 . Social Security numbers: C. PII 4 . Driver's license numbers: C. PII Medical records are an example of protected health information (PHI). Trade secrets are an example of proprietary data. Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers are examples of PII; if they were used in a medical context, they may also be PHI, but this question does not ask you to consider them in that context. 101 . C. Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) can be on-site or cloud-based and are security policy enforcement points that operate between users and cloud services. A CASB can provide insight into what users are doing, enforce policies, provide threat protection, and even provide data loss prevention capabilities. An SIEM collects logs and event information as part of security monitoring and event management. A DLP system focuses on data loss prevention and data security but won't address an organization's full set of security policies and practices in the cloud, and NGFWs, or next-generation firewalls, provide a variety of security services but are not specifically designed to implement cloud policy. 102 . A. The devices have reached end of support (EOS), and the vendor will no longer provide updates or support for it. End of development occurs when no new software updates or patches are being released. End of life and end of sales often occur at the same time when the vendor no longer sells the device. Support will typically continue even after end of life (EOL). 103 . D. Asset owners are responsible for assets in an organization, including their procurement, management, and life cycle. Unlike data roles, there are typically fewer asset roles in play, and asset custodian is not a commonly recognized role. Since these are hardware devices, Gary's role is not as a data custodian or owner in the scope of this question. 104 . A. Modifying baselines to better suit an organization is known as tailoring. Scoping occurs when baselines are reviewed to ensure that only controls suited to the environment or system are used. Editing and defining are not terms used on the exam for these activities. 105 . B. Data location, particularly at rest, may drive compliance requirements based on local or national laws. This concern drives the majority of data location concerns. Ensuring data is not lost is a data handling and management practice topic, geographic location may be related to cost but storage media and services drive cost far more than physical location, and data custodians are likely to work with data regardless of location. Chapter 3: Security Architecture and Engineering (Domain 3) 1 . D. The Brewer-Nash model allows access controls to change dynamically based upon a user's actions. It is often used in environments like Matthew's to implement a “Chinese wall” between data belonging to different clients. 2 . A. Fires may be detected as early as the incipient stage. During this stage, air ionization takes place, and specialized incipient fire detection systems can identify these changes to provide early warning of a fire. 3 . A. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems act as a secondary verification mechanism for physical presence because they allow security officials to view the interior of the facility when a motion alarm sounds to determine the current occupants and their activities. 4 . B. In an m of n control system, at least m of n possible escrow agents must collaborate to retrieve an 136/220 encryption key from the escrow database. 5 . A. This is an example of a vendor offering a fully functional application as a web-based service. Therefore, it fits under the definition of software as a service (SaaS). In infrastructure as a service (IaaS), compute as a service (CaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS), the customer provides their own software. In this example, the vendor is providing the email software, so none of those choices is appropriate. 6 . B. The Digital Signature Standard approves three encryption algorithms for use in digital signatures: the Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA) algorithm; the Elliptic Curve DSA (ECDSA) algorithm, and the Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA). HAVAL is a hash function, not an encryption algorithm. While hash functions are used as part of the digital signature process, they do not provide encryption. 7 . A. In the subject/object model of access control, the user or process making the request for a resource is the subject of that request. In this example, Harry is requesting resource access and is, therefore, the subject. 8 . C. Michael should conduct his investigation, but there is a pressing business need to bring the website back online. The most reasonable course of action would be to take a snapshot of the compromised system and use the snapshot for the investigation, restoring the website to operation as quickly as possible while using the results of the investigation to improve the security of the site. 9 . C. Using a sandbox is an example of confinement, where the system restricts the access of a particular process to limit its ability to affect other processes running on the same system. 10 . D. Assurance is the degree of confidence that an organization has that its security controls are correctly implemented. It must be continually monitored and reverified. 11 . A. Maintenance hooks, otherwise known as backdoors, provide developers with easy access to a system, bypassing normal security controls. If not removed prior to finalizing code, they pose a significant security vulnerability if an attacker discovers the maintenance hook. 12 . B. The Simple Integrity Property states that an individual may not read a file classified at a lower security level than the individual's security clearance. 13 . B. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used to control and gather data from industrial processes. They are commonly found in power plants and other industrial environments. 14 . B. The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a hardware security technique that stores an encryption key on a chip on the motherboard and prevents someone from accessing an encrypted drive by installing it in another computer. 15 . D. Intentional collisions have been created with MD5, and a real-world collision attack against SHA 1was announced in early 2017. 3DES is not a hashing tool, leaving SHA 256 (sometimes called SHA 2) as the only real choice that Chris has in this list. 16 . C. In an asymmetric cryptosystem, the sender of a message encrypts the message using the recipient's public key. The recipient may then decrypt that message using their own private key, which only they should possess. 17 . D. When Bob receives the message, he uses his own private key to decrypt it. Since he is the only one with his private key, he is the only one who should be able to decrypt it, thus preserving confidentiality. 18 . B. Each user retains their own private key as secret information. In this scenario, Bob would only have access to his own private key and would not have access to the private key of Alice or any other user. 19 . B. Alice creates the digital signature using her own private key. Then Bob, or any other user, can verify the digital signature using Alice's public key. 20 . B. The salt is a random value added to a password before it is hashed by the operating system. The salt is then stored in a password file with the hashed password. This increases the complexity of cryptanalytic attacks by negating the usefulness of attacks that use precomputed hash values, such as rainbow tables. 21 . A. Hash functions do not include any element of secrecy and, therefore, do not require a cryptographic key. 22 . D. A preaction fire suppression system activates in two steps. The pipes fill with water once the early signs of a fire are detected. The system does not dispense water until heat sensors on the sprinkler heads trigger the second phase. 23 . B. The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol provides confidentiality and integrity for packet contents. It encrypts packet payloads and provides limited authentication and protection against replay attacks. 24 . D. The greatest risk when a device is lost or stolen is that sensitive data contained on the device will fall into the wrong hands. Confidentiality processes protect against this risk. Nonrepudiation is when the recipient of a message can prove the originator's identity to a third party. Authentication is a means of proving one's identity. Integrity demonstrates that information has not been modified since transmission. 25 . A. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems, or SCADA systems, provide a graphical interface to monitor industrial control systems (ICS). Joanna should ask about access to her organization's SCADA systems. 26 . C. The *-Security Property states that an individual may not write to a file at a lower classification level than that of the individual. This is also known as the confinement property. 27 . B. The Diffie-Hellman algorithm allows for the secure exchange of symmetric encryption keys over a public network. IDEA and RSA are encryption algorithms. MD5 is a hashing function. 28 . D. The principle of least privilege says that an employee should have only the minimum necessary privileges required to perform their jobs. Privilege creep indicates that an employee has accumulated permissions that they no longer require, indicating a violation of the least privilege principle. The trust but verify principle says that organizations should use auditing to ensure that control objectives are met. The fail securely principle says that security controls should default to a secure state in the event of a control failure. The keep it simple and secure principle says that security controls and other technologies should remain as simple as possible while still completing their objectives. 29 . C. In a zero trust network architecture, access control decisions should never be made based upon a system's location on the network. Therefore, an IP address should never be used and would be the least appropriate of these options. While the other options have differing levels of security (two-factor authentication is clearly stronger than a password or biometrics alone), they do not violate the principles of a zero trust network architecture. 30 . D. While defense in depth is a strong security principle, it is not a component of Privacy by Design. The following are the seven principles of the Privacy by Design model: 1 . Proactive, not reactive; preventative not remedial 2 . Privacy as the default 3 . Privacy embedded into design 137/220 4 . Full functionality—positive-sum, not zero-sum 5 . End-to-end life-cycle protection 6 . Visibility and transparency 7 . Respect for user privacy 31 . B. Kerckhoffs' principle says that a cryptographic system should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. 32 . A. Access control vestibules use two sets of doors to control access to a facility. This may be used to prevent piggybacking by monitoring use of the vestibule to allow only a single individual to enter a facility at a time. They may also be used to allow manual inspection of individuals or perform other security screening. Access control vestibules are also commonly known as mantraps. 33 . A. While it would be ideal to have wiring closets in a location where they are monitored by security staff, this is not feasible in most environments. Wiring closets must be distributed geographically in multiple locations across each building used by an organization. 34 . D. The *-Integrity Property states that a subject cannot modify an object at a higher integrity level than that possessed by the subject. 35 . D. The segregation of duties principle says that no employee should have permission to perform two tasks that, when combined, would pose a security risk. In this situation, an employee auditing their own work would create a conflict of interest, so Lana has implemented a segregation of duties. Two-person control is closely related, but it requires that two different employees approve an action. If she required that two managers approve new accounts, that would be an example of two-person control. 36 . A, B, C, D. All of these statements are correct. The idea that systems should be designed to operate in a secure manner if the user performs no other configuration is the secure defaults principle. The idea that systems should be designed to fall back to a secure state if they experience an error is the fail securely principle. The idea that systems should be designed to incorporate security as a design feature is the security by design principle. The idea that systems should be designed in a manner that keeps their functionality as simple as possible is the keep it simple principle. 37 . A. EAL1 assurance applies when the system in question has been functionally tested. It is the lowest level of assurance under the Common Criteria. 38 . B. The system can be designed in a manner that protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. The research workstations included in the grid are from internal users, minimizing the risk of distributing the data. However, an isolation breach in the distributed computing client could be catastrophic, allowing someone who compromises the controller to assume control of every device in the organization. 39 . A. This is an example of a microservices architecture. Each of the component microservices performs a discrete task and then communicates with other microservices using APIs. This might be accomplished using function-as-a-service (FaaS) cloud computing, containerization, and/or virtualization, but there is no indication whether those services are being used in the scenario. 40 . A. Adam created a list of individual users who may access the file. This is an access control list, which consists of multiple access control entries. It includes the names of users, so it is not role-based, and Adam was able to modify the list, so it is not mandatory access control. 41 . C. Parameter checking, or input validation, is used to ensure that input provided by users to an application matches the expected parameters for the application. Developers may use parameter checking to ensure that input does not exceed the expected length, preventing a buffer overflow attack. 42 . D. The defense-in-depth principle suggests using multiple overlapping security controls to achieve the same control objective. Network and host firewalls are both designed to limit network traffic and therefore are an example of defense in depth. The encryption of email and network intrusion detection are unrelated controls and do not satisfy the same objective. The same is true for the combination of CASB and security awareness training and the combination of DLP and multifactor authentication. 43 . D. Multistate systems are certified to handle data from different security classifications simultaneously by implementing protection mechanisms that segregate data appropriately. 44 . C. For systems running in System High mode, the user must have a valid security clearance for all information processed by the system, access approval for all information processed by the system, and a valid need to know for some, but not necessarily all, information processed by the system. 45 . B. Steganography is the art of using cryptographic techniques to embed secret messages within other content. Some steganographic algorithms work by making alterations to the least significant bits of the many bits that make up image files. 46 . D. All of these terms accurately describe this use of technology. However, the use of Docker is best described as a containerization technology, so this is the best possible answer choice. 47 . A. The kernel lies within the central ring, Ring 0. Conceptually, Ring 1 contains other operating system components. Ring 2 is used for drivers and protocols. User-level programs and applications run at Ring 3. Rings 0 through 2 run in privileged mode, while Ring 3 runs in user mode. It is important to note that many modern operating systems do not fully implement this model. 48 . D. In an infrastructure-as-a-service environment, security duties follow a shared responsibility model. Since the vendor is responsible for managing the storage hardware, the vendor would retain responsibility for destroying or wiping drives as they are taken out of service. However, it is still the customer's responsibility to validate that the vendor's sanitization procedures meet their requirements prior to utilizing the vendor's storage services. 49 . C. The first thing Casey should do is notify her management, but after that, replacing the certificate and using proper key management practices with the new certificate's key should be at the top of her list. 50 . C. The verification process is similar to the certification process in that it validates security controls. Verification may go a step further by involving a third-party testing service and compiling results that may be trusted by many different organizations. Accreditation is the act of management formally accepting a system, not evaluating the system itself. 51 . D. In a serverless computing model, the vendor does not expose details of the operating system to its customers. Therefore, the vendor retains full responsibility for configuring it securely under the shared responsibility model of cloud computing. 52 . B. The mean time to failure (MTTF) provides the average amount of time before a device of that particular specification fails. 53 . C. Asymmetric cryptosystems use a pair of keys for each user. In this case, with 1,000 users, the system will 138/220 require 2,000 keys. 499,500 would be the correct answer for a symmetric system. 54 . A. Mobile Device Management (MDM) products provide a consistent, centralized interface for applying security configuration settings to mobile devices. 55 . C. Nonrepudiation occurs when the recipient of a message is able to demonstrate to a third party that the message came from the purported sender. 56 . A. The card shown in the image has a smart chip underneath the American flag. Therefore, it is an example of a smart card. This is the most secure type of identification card technology. 57 . D. The TEMPEST program creates technology that is not susceptible to Van Eck phreaking attacks because it reduces or suppresses natural electromagnetic emanations. 58 . A. Golden ticket attacks use the hash of the Kerberos service account to create tickets in an Active Directory environment. Kerberoasting attacks rely on collected TGS tickets. Pass the ticket attacks rely on tickets harvested from the LSASS process. Brute-force attacks depend on random guessing without any additional information. 59 . A. The MD5 hashing algorithm has known collisions and, as of 2005, is no longer considered secure for use in modern environments. The AES, PGP, and WPA3 algorithms are all still considered secure. 60 . B. The use of the Mimikatz tool is indicative of an attempt to capture user password hashes for use in a passthe-hash attack against Microsoft Active Directory accounts. 61 . C. In a known plaintext attack, the attacker has a copy of the encrypted message along with the plaintext message used to generate that ciphertext. In a chosen plaintext attack, the attacker has the ability to choose the plaintext to be encrypted. In a chosen ciphertext attack, the attacker can choose the ciphertext output. In a brute-force attack, the attacker simply tries all possible key combinations. 62 . B. In a time of check to time of use (TOCTOU) attack, the attacker exploits the difference in time between when a security control is verified and the data protected by the control is actually used. 63 . B. In this case, most cloud service models (including IaaS, SaaS, and serverless/FaaS) would require transmitting most information back to the cloud. The edge computing service model would be far more appropriate, as it places computing power at the sensor, minimizing the data that must be sent back to the cloud over limited connectivity network links. 64 . B. Wear leveling is about writing to the disk evenly. Encrypting the data would protect against the disclosure of data on portions of the disk that have remnants due to too much wear and having been set aside as no longer usable. Disk formatting does not effectively remove data from any device. Degaussing is effective only for magnetic media. Physically destroying the drive would not permit reuse. 65 . C. In an aggregation attack, individual(s) use their access to specific pieces of information to piece together a larger picture that they are not authorized to access. 66 . D. While all of the controls mentioned protect against unwanted electromagnetic emanations, only white noise is an active control. White noise generates false emanations that effectively “jam” the true emanations from electronic equipment. 67 . B. In a software-as-a-service environment, the customer has no access to any underlying infrastructure, so firewall management is a vendor responsibility under the cloud computing shared responsibility model. 68 . C. The grant rule allows a subject to grant rights that it possesses on an object to another subject. 69 . B. The system Charles is remediating may have a firmware or BIOS infection, with malware resident on the system board. While uncommon, this type of malware can be difficult to find and remove. Since he used original media, it is unlikely that the malware came from the software vendor. Charles wiped the system partition, and the system would have been rebooted before being rebuilt, thus clearing system memory. 70 . C. Lauren has implemented address space layout randomization, a memory protection methodology that randomizes memory locations, which prevents attackers from using known address spaces and contiguous memory regions to execute code via overflow or stack smashing attacks. 71 . C. This message was most likely encrypted with a transposition cipher. The use of a substitution cipher, a category that includes AES and 3DES, would change the frequency distribution so that it did not mirror that of the English language. This type of attack, where the attacker only has access to an encrypted message, is also known as a ciphertext-only attack. 72 . A. In a zero trust network architecture, the policy engine is responsible for making policy decisions based upon rules and external data sources. It uses a trust algorithm to decide whether to grant, deny, or revoke access, considering factors like identity management, threat intelligence, and security information and event management (SIEM) data. The policy administrator, on the other hand, acts based on the decisions made by the policy engine, establishing or removing communication paths and managing session-specific credentials. The policy enforcement point enforces these decisions by controlling access to resources based on instructions from the policy administrator. Lastly, the subject refers to users, services, or systems that request access or attempt to use rights and is not involved in decision-making. 73 . A. The blacklisting approach to application control allows users to install any software they want except for packages specifically identified by the administrator as prohibited. This would be an appropriate approach in a scenario where users should be able to install any nonmalicious software they want to use. 74 . A. Heartbeat sensors send periodic status messages from the alarm system to the monitoring center. The monitoring center triggers an alarm if it does not receive a status message for a prolonged period of time, indicating that communications were disrupted. 75 . B. In a zero-knowledge proof, one individual demonstrates to another that they can achieve a result that requires sensitive information without actually disclosing the sensitive information. 76 . A. When operating system patches are no longer available for mobile devices, the best option is typically to retire or replace the device. Building isolated networks will not stop the device from being used for browsing or other purposes, which means it is likely to continue to be exposed to threats. Installing a firewall will not remediate the security flaws in the OS, although it may help somewhat. Finally, reinstalling the OS will not allow new updates or fix the root issue. 77 . A. In a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker tricks the user into establishing a connection with the attacker. The attacker then establishes a connection to the legitimate server and relays communications between the two, eavesdropping on the contents. A meet-in-the-middle attack is an attack against cryptographic algorithms that use multiple rounds of encryption. There is no indication in the scenario that the attacker used an exhaustive brute-force attack or a specialized timing attack to achieve their goals. 78 . A. Digital signatures are possible only when using an asymmetric encryption algorithm. Of the algorithms listed, 139/220 only RSA is asymmetric and supports digital signature capabilities. 79 . C. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) produces an annual list of the top 10 web application security issues that developers and security professionals around the world rely upon for education and training purposes. The OWASP vulnerabilities form the basis for many web application security testing products. 80 . A. The information flow model applies state machines to the flow of information. The Bell-LaPadula model applies the information flow model to confidentiality, while the Biba model applies it to integrity. 81 . C. The most reasonable choice presented is to move the devices to a secure and isolated network segment. This will allow the devices to continue to serve their intended function while preventing them from being compromised. All of the other scenarios either create major new costs or deprive her organization of the functionality that the devices were purchased to provide. 82 . C. Capacitance motion detectors monitor the electromagnetic field in a monitored area, sensing disturbances that correspond to motion. 83 . D. Mirai targeted “Internet of Things” devices, including routers, cameras, and DVRs. As organizations bring an increasing number of devices like these into their corporate networks, protecting both internal and external targets from insecure, infrequently updated, and often vulnerable IoT devices is increasingly important. 84 . D. The Biba model focuses only on protecting integrity and does not provide protection against confidentiality or availability threats. It also does not provide protection against covert channel attacks. The Biba model focuses on external threats and assumes that internal threats are addressed programmatically. 85 . A. In TLS, both the server and the client communicate using an ephemeral symmetric session key. They generate this key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm and then communicate using it throughout the rest of the session. 86 . B. A Faraday cage is a metal skin that prevents electromagnetic emanations from exiting. It is a rarely used technology because it is unwieldy and expensive, but it is quite effective at blocking unwanted electromagnetic radiation. 87 . B. The hypervisor is responsible for coordinating access to physical hardware and enforcing isolation between different virtual machines running on the same physical platform. 88 . B. Cloud computing systems where the customer only provides application code for execution on a vendorsupplied computing platform are examples of platform-as-a-service (PaaS) computing. 89 . B. A well-designed data center should have redundant systems and capabilities for each critical part of its infrastructure. That means that power, cooling, and network connectivity should all be redundant. Kim should determine how to ensure that a single system failure cannot take her data center offline. 90 . B. UPSs are designed to protect against short-term power losses, such as power faults. When they conduct power conditioning, they are also able to protect against sags and noise. UPSs have limited-life batteries and are not able to maintain continuous operating during a sustained blackout. 91 . D. Data center humidity should be maintained between 20% and 80%. Values below this range increase the risk of static electricity, while values above this range may generate moisture that damages equipment. 92 . A, B. Payment of a ransom often results in the release of a decryption key, but this is not guaranteed by any means. There is also no link between the payment of a ransom and a future data breach, as an attacker may choose to release confidential information regardless of whether the ransom was paid. Depending upon applicable jurisdictions, payment of a ransom may be illegal under corrupt practices laws or embargoes against terrorist organizations. For example, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued an advisory in 2020 stating that ransom payments may violate sanctions. Payment of a ransom may also cause attackers to consider the victim a “mark” and demand future payments in exchange for continued access to their data. 93 . D. Alex can use digital rights management technology to limit use of the PDFs to paying customers. While DRM is rarely a perfect solution, in this case, it may fit his organization's needs. EDM is electronic dance music, which his customers may appreciate but which won't solve the problem. Encryption and digital signatures can help to keep the files secure and to prove who they came from but won't solve the rights management issue Alex is tackling. 94 . B. Matt is helping to maintain the chain of custody documentation for his electronic evidence. This can be important if his organization needs to prove that the digital evidence they handled has not been tampered with. A better process would involve more than one person to ensure that no tampering was possible. 95 . A. The certificate revocation list contains the serial numbers of digital certificates issued by a certificate authority that have later been revoked. 96 . A. The point of the digital certificate is to prove to Alison that the server belongs to the bank, so she does not need to have this trust in advance. To trust the certificate, she must verify the CA's digital signature on the certificate, trust the CA, verify that the certificate is not listed on a CRL, and verify that the certificate contains the name of the bank. 97 . C. Covert channels use surreptitious communications' paths. Covert timing channels alter the use of a resource in a measurable fashion to exfiltrate information. If a user types using a specific rhythm of Morse code, this is an example of a covert timing channel. Someone watching or listening to the keystrokes could receive a secret message with no trace of the message left in logs. 98 . C. Self-signed digital certificates should be used only for internal-facing applications, where the user base trusts the internally generated digital certificate. 99 . D. In a fault injection attack, the attacker attempts to compromise the integrity of a cryptographic device by causing some type of external fault. For example, they might use high-voltage electricity, high or low temperature, or other factors to cause a malfunction that undermines the security of the device. Side-channel attacks seek to use information about system activity and retrieve information that is actively being encrypted. Brute-force attacks attempt every possible valid combination for a key or password. In a timing attack, the attacker measures precisely how long cryptographic operations take to complete, gaining information about the cryptographic process that may be used to undermine its security. 100 . The security models match with the descriptions as follows: 1 . Clark-Wilson: C. This model uses security labels to grant access to objects via transformation procedures and a restricted interface model. 2 . Bell-LaPadula: A. This model blocks lower-classified objects from accessing higher-classified objects, thus ensuring confidentiality. 3 . Biba: B. The * property of this model can be summarized as “no write-up.” 140/220 101 . The architecture security concepts match with the descriptions as follows: 1 . Time of check: C. The time at which the subject checks whether an object is available 2 . Covert channel: A. A method used to pass information over a path not normally used for communication 3 . Time of use: D. The time at which a subject can access an object 4 . Maintenance hooks: E. An access method known only to the developer of the system 5 . Parameter checking: F. A method that can help prevent buffer overflow attacks 6 . Race condition: B. The exploitation of the reliance of a system's behavior on the sequence of events that occur externally Chapter 4: Communication and Network Security (Domain 4) 1 . B. BitTorrent is an example of a peer-to-peer (P2P) content delivery network. It is commonly used for legitimate purposes to distribute large files like Linux ISOs and other freely distributed software packages and files in addition to its less legitimate uses. CloudFlare, CloudFront, and Akamai's Edge are all hosted CDNs. 2 . B. VDOMs are instances of firewalls, each with their own interfaces and rulesets allowing granular configurations based on security requirements. VDOMs are commonly used to accommodate different purposes, customers, or other needs where separately managed firewall instances are desirable. They don't combine instances; instead, they create separate instances, they aren't domain controllers, and hosting multiple domain names does not require a VDOM. 3 . C. Ben is using ad hoc mode, which directly connects two clients. It can be easy to confuse this with standalone mode, which connects clients using a wireless access point but not to wired resources like a central network. Infrastructure mode connects endpoints to a central network, not directly to each other. Finally, wired extension mode uses a wireless access point to link wireless clients to a wired network. 4 . C. A collision domain is the set of systems that could cause a collision if they transmitted at the same time. Systems outside a collision domain cannot cause a collision if they send at the same time. This is important, as the number of systems in a collision domain increases the likelihood of network congestion due to an increase in collisions. A broadcast domain is the set of systems that can receive a broadcast from each other. A subnet is a logical division of a network, while a supernet is made up of two or more networks. 5 . D. The RST flag is used to reset or disconnect a session. It can be resumed by restarting the connection via a new three-way handshake. 6 . D. He should choose 802.11ax, which supports theoretical speeds up to 9.6 Gbps. 802.11ac supports up to 5.9 Gbps, 802.11n supports up to 600 Mbps, and 802.11g is only capable up to 54 Mbps. 7 . D. Both FTP/S and SFTP are commonly used as replacement insecure FTP services. SFTP offers the advantage of using SSH for transfers, making it easy to use existing firewall rules. TFTP is trivial FTP, an insecure quick transfer method often used to transfer files for network devices, among other uses. HFTPS and SecFTP were made up for this question. 8 . A. The Network layer, or layer 3, uses IP addresses for logical addressing. TCP and UDP protocols are used at the Transport layer, which is layer 4. Hardware addresses are used at layer 2, the Data Link layer, and sending and receiving bits via hardware is done at the Physical layer (layer 1). 9 . D. Most networks include many edge devices like wireless access points and edge switches. These devices often have a single power supply to balance cost against reliability and will simply be replaced if they fail. More critical devices like routers and core switches are typically equipped with redundant power supplies to ensure that larger segments of the network do not fail if a component fails. Of course, making sure devices are supported so they get updates and that they are under warranty are both common practices for supportable networks. 10 . B. Brian is analyzing the jitter, which is the variance in delay between packets. This can indicate issues along the path the packets take. Latency is the time it takes a packet to reach its destination, throughput is a measure of the volume of traffic that can be sent, and signal to noise ratios compare the amount of desired information that is received versus the level of background noise or unwanted data. 11 . B. The Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol was originally designed to support dial-up modem connections but is still commonly used for VPN-based authentication. HTTPS is not an authentication protocol. ESP and AH are IPsec protocols but do not provide authentication services for other systems. 12 . C. SIPS, the secure version of the Session Initialization Protocol for VoIP, adds TLS encryption to keep the session initialization process secure. SVOIP and PBSX are not real protocols, but SRTP is the secure version of RTP, the Real time Transport Protocol. 13 . B. The firewall in the diagram has two protected zones behind it, making it a two-tier firewall design. 14 . D. Segmentation is a critical concept for network designers. Remote PCs that connect to a protected network need to comply with security settings and standards that match those required for the internal network. The VPN concentrator logically places remote users in the protected zone behind the firewall, but that means user workstations (and users) must be trusted in the same way that local workstations are. 15 . D. Micro-segmentation is used to logically separate systems and services by defining boundaries between them. This is often part of a zero trust architecture including the use of on-demand access to services. Converged protocols implement other protocols over another protocol like iSCSI or InfiniBand over Ethernet. Physical segmentation uses separate physical devices and infrastructure to provide segmentation. Edge networks place computation and storage closer to the end user. 16 . B. Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) is used to allow multiple routing tables to exist in a virtual router, all working simultaneously as defined by network traffic rules. A VPC may include VRF capabilities, but VRF would still be required to complete this requirement. VLANs are used to separate network segments, not to provide routing, and a content distribution network is used to provide high-performance, denial-of-service-resistant content replication and access from a large-scale network of replicas. 17 . B. Disabling SSID broadcast can help prevent unauthorized personnel from attempting to connect to the network. Since the SSID is still active, it can be discovered by using a wireless sniffer. Encryption keys are not related to SSID broadcast, beacon frames are used to broadcast the SSID, and it is possible to have multiple networks with the same SSID. 18 . A. Software-defined networking (SDN) uses code to configure and control the network. This allows for agile, programmatic control and configuration as needed from a central control point. SD-WAN provides the same sort 141/220 of control for wide area network links, which aren't mentioned in this question. Proxy routing occurs when a proxy server routes traffic between clients and other systems, and agile networking is not a commonly used term. 19 . C. iSCSI is a converged protocol that supports SCSI storage access via Ethernet. CXL is Compute Express Link, often used to interconnect memory, CPUs, and accelerators. SD-WAN is a software-defined wide area network, and Zigbee is a low-power wireless protocol. 20 . B. Peering allows you to connect directly to a provider's network at a peering location where they provide edge facilities. This can reduce ingress/egress costs as well as provide direct paths to their networks and services. Replication of data is not an artifact of or a result of peering. Controlling traffic flows via software-defined routes is done using SD-WAN, and hosting copies of sites at multiple locations is a typical result of using a CDN. 21 . C. Traffic sent between systems in the same data center is called east/west traffic since it does not flow across network boundaries. East/west traffic requires additional design work in many organizations if monitoring and other security is desired. Traffic that is external to the data center, either inbound or outbound, is called north/south traffic. Privileged/unprivileged and store/forward are not typically used to describe the traffic flows in the question. 22 . A. Multilayer protocols like Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) allow SCADA and other systems to use TCP/IP-based networks to communicate. Many SCADA devices were never designed to be exposed to a network, and adding them to a potentially insecure network can create significant risks. TLS or other encryption can be used on TCP packets, meaning that even serial data can be protected. Serial data can be carried via TCP packets because TCP packets don't care about their content; it is simply another payload. Finally, TCP/IP does not have a specific throughput as designed, so issues with throughput are device-level issues. 23 . B. WPA3's simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) mode improves on WPA2's pre-shared key (PSK) mode by allowing for secure authentication between clients and the wireless network without enterprise user accounts. If Ben needed to worry about support for WPA3, which may not be available to all systems that may want to connect, he might have to choose WPA2. A captive portal is often used with open guest networks but requires additional work to maintain, and Enterprise mode requires user accounts. 24 . A. SMS messages are not encrypted, meaning that they could be sniffed and captured. While using two factors is more secure than a single factor, SMS is one of the less secure ways to implement two-factor authentication because of this. SMS messages can be spoofed, can be received by more than one phone, and are typically stored on the recipient's phone. The primary threat here, however, is the unencrypted message itself. 25 . A. 802.11ac operates in the 5 GHz range. The 900 MHz range has frequently been used for phones and nonWi-Fi wireless networks as well as other amateur radio uses, and 2.4 GHz is used by 802.11n and other protocols. Knowing that multiple ranges are available and that they may behave differently based on how many access points are in use and whether other devices that may cause interference on that band are in the area can be important for wireless network deployments. 26 . B. ARP and RARP operate at the Data Link layer, the second layer of the OSI model. Both protocols deal with physical hardware addresses, which are used above the Physical layer (layer 1) and below the Network layer (layer 3), thus falling at the Data Link layer. 27 . D. Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) is a converged protocol that allows location-independent file services over traditional network technologies. It costs less than traditional Fibre Channel. VoIP is Voice over IP, SDN is software-defined networking, and MPLS is Multiprotocol Label Switching, a technology that uses path labels instead of network addresses. 28 . A. A repeater, switch, or concentrator will amplify the signal, ensuring that the 100-meter distance limitation of 1000BaseT is not an issue. A gateway would be useful if network protocols were changing, while Cat7 cable is appropriate for a 10 Gbps network at much shorter distances. STP cable is limited to 155 Mbps and 100 meters, which would leave Chris with network problems. 29 . B. The use of TCP port 80 indicates that the messaging service is using the HTTP protocol. Slack is a messaging service that runs over HTTPS, which uses port 443. SMTP is an email protocol that uses port 25. 30 . C. HTTP traffic is typically sent via TCP80. Unencrypted HTTP traffic can be easily captured at any point between A and B, meaning that the messaging solution chosen does not provide confidentiality for the organization's corporate communications. 31 . B. If a business need requires messaging, using a local messaging server is the best option. This prevents traffic from traveling to a third-party server and can offer additional benefits such as logging, archiving, and control of security options like the use of encryption. 32 . B. Multilayer protocols create three primary concerns for security practitioners: they can conceal covert channels (and thus covert channels are allowed), filters can be bypassed by traffic concealed in layered protocols, and the logical boundaries put in place by network segments can be bypassed under some circumstances. Multilayer protocols allow encryption at various layers and support a range of protocols at higher layers. 33 . A. Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI), and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) are all examples of converged protocols that combine specialized protocols with standard protocols like TCP/IP. Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIIME) is not a converged protocol. 34 . B. When a workstation or other device is connected simultaneously to both a secure network and a nonsecure network like the Internet, it may act as a bridge, bypassing the security protections located at the edge of a corporate network. It is unlikely that traffic will be routed improperly, leading to the exposure of sensitive data, as traffic headed to internal systems and networks is unlikely to be routed to the external network. Reflected DDoS attacks are used to hide identities rather than to connect through to an internal network, and security administrators of managed systems should be able to determine both the local and wireless IP addresses his system uses. 35 . D. Observability focuses on the ability to see how an entire system, service, or environment is performing and behaving based on its external outputs. That means that telemetry data—information about what components are doing—is critical and will be gathered using logs, metrics, and real-time analysis. This means that centralizing and aggregating data, enabling alerts for critical errors, and implementing logging using standardized formats are all common practices. Feedback loops are also important, allowing administrators and others to take action when problems or issues are detected. 36 . A. IPsec can provide encryption, access control, nonrepudiation, and message authentication using public key cryptography. It does not provide authorization, protocol convergence, content distribution, or the other items 142/220 listed. 37 . B. Zigbee uses AES to protect network traffic, providing integrity and confidentiality controls. It does not use 3DES, and ROT13 is a simple rotational cipher you might find in a cereal box or secret decoder ring. 38 . C. The process of using a fake Media Access Control (MAC) address is called spoofing, and spoofing a MAC address already in use on the network can lead to an address collision, preventing traffic from reaching one or both systems. Tokens are used in token ring networks, which are outdated, and EUI refers to an Extended Unique Identifier, another term for MAC address, but token loss is still not the issue. Broadcast domains refer to the set of machines a host can send traffic to via a broadcast message. 39 . C. While security features vary from provider to provider, encryption, device-based authentication (for example, using certificates), and SIM-based authentication are all common options for 4G connectivity solutions. Joanna should work with her provider to determine what capabilities are available and assess whether they meet her needs. 40 . D. Application-specific protocols are handled at layer 7, the Application layer of the OSI model. 41 . B. AVPC, or virtual private cloud, is the environment many organizations operate inside of public clouds. They provide on-demand access to configurable, shared resources operated by the cloud provider inside of their isolated boundaries. VLANs are used to logically separate networks; SDN is software-defined networking, which is typically part of how a VPC is implemented; and CXL, or Compute Express Link, is a converged protocol used to connect CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, and other components at high speeds. 42 . D. 802.1x provides port-based authentication and can be used with technologies like the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). 802.11a is a wireless standard, 802.3 is the standard for Ethernet, and 802.15.1 was the original Bluetooth IEEE standard. 43 . D. 1000BaseT is capable of a 100-meter run according to its specifications. For longer distances and exterior runs, a fiber-optic cable is typically used in modern networks. 44 . A. Port security prevents unrecognized or unpermitted systems from connecting to a network port based on their MAC address. Cloning a permitted or legitimate MAC address attempts to bypass this. VLAN hopping and 802.1q trunking attacks attempt to access other subnets by encapsulating packets so they will be unwrapped and directed to the other subnet. Etherkiller prevention is not a security setting or control. 45 . C. Most modern applications support TLS throughout their communications allowing clients to securely connect to the service and to encrypt communications. VPN, either in software or hardware form, will be more complex and unwieldy. Software-based VPN would be more flexible, and hardware-based VPN would be more expensive and more complex. SIPS and SRTP are appropriate for a VoIP environment but are not generally a complete solution for a modern multimedia collaboration platform like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or WebEx. 46 . B. Zigbee is designed for this type of low-power, Internet of Things network, and would be the best option for Chris. Some versions of Bluetooth are designed to operate in low-power mode as well, but Bluetooth isn't in this list of answers. Wi-Fi requires more power, NFC is very short range and would not work across a building or room, and infrared requires line of sight and is rarely used for that reason. 47 . C. Separate, physically isolated Ethernet networks that require strong authentication are a commonly used outof-band (OOB) option. While direct physical access is also an acceptable out-of-band option, it does not work well in a complex, production-oriented environment where devices may not be safe or easy to access. Web clients and nonstandard ports are not out-of-band options as described. 48 . A. A content delivery network run by a major provider can handle large-scale DDoS attacks more easily than any of the other solutions. Using DDoS mitigation techniques via an ISP is the next most useful capability, followed by both increases in bandwidth and increases in the number of servers in the web application cluster. 49 . C. PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPsec are the most common VPN protocols. TLS is also used for an increasingly large percentage of VPN connections and may appear at some point in the CISSP exam. PPP is a dial-up protocol, LTP is not a protocol, and SPAP is the Shiva Password Authentication Protocol sometimes used with PPTP. 50 . A, B. Wayne should consider the use of a dedicated VLAN for VoIP devices to help separate them from other networked devices, and he should also require the use of SIPS and SRTP, both secure protocols that will keep his VoIP traffic encrypted. Requiring the use of VPN for all remote VoIP devices is not necessary if SIPS and SRTP are in use, and a specific IPS for VoIP is not a typical deployment in most organizations. 51 . C. The Physical layer includes electrical specifications, protocols, and standards that allow control of throughput, handling line noise, and a variety of other electrical interface and signaling requirements. The OSI layer doesn't have a Device layer. The Transport layer connects the Network and Session layers, and the Data Link layer packages packets from the network layer for transmission and receipt by devices operating on the Physical layer. 52 . D. WPA3, the replacement for WPA2, adds security features including a new mode called simultaneous authentication of equals that replaces the pre-shared key mode from WPA2 with a more secure option. Overall, it provides security improvements but may not be immediately implemented due to time for hardware and software to fully support it. WPA2 has been the most commonly deployed wireless security standard having replaced WPA and WEP. 53 . D. Cut-through switching forwards packets as soon as the destination address is known without waiting for the rest of the frame to arrive. This means that packets are not checked for integrity before being forwarded, optimizing throughput and reducing latency at the expense of error checking. Store-and-forward waits for the entire frame to allow it to be checked using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) before forwarding it. Blind and forward switching were made up for this question. 54 . A. The Transport layer provides logical connections between devices, including end-to-end transport services to ensure that data is delivered. Transport layer protocols include TCP, UDP, SSL, and TLS. 55 . B. Machine Access Control (MAC) addresses are the hardware address the machine uses for layer 2 communications. The MAC addresses include an organizationally unique identifier (OUI), which identifies the manufacturer. MAC addresses can be changed, so this is not a guarantee of accuracy, but under normal circumstances you can tell what manufacturer made the device by using the MAC address. 56 . C. For long-term connections like backhaul networks, a point-to-point VPN that is connected at all times is the most common choice to ensure all traffic is secured. TLS and SSH are commonly used to tunnel data but require additional attention to ensure that all traffic is tunneled. On-demand VPNs are more commonly used by users than for a connection like a backhaul network link. 57 . C. Double NATing isn't possible with the same IP range; the same IP addresses cannot appear inside and 143/220 outside a NAT router. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved, but only so they are not used and routable on the Internet, and changing to PAT would not fix the issue. 58 . B. A Class B network holds 2^16 systems, and its default network mask is 255.255.0.0. 59 . B. Enabling waiting rooms allows hosts to allow only intended attendees for events and meetings. Unfortunately, passcodes are easily shared, resulting in Zoom bombing despite the security they appear to offer. Meeting links are automatically generated and randomized, preventing brute forcing, and HTTPS is enabled by default for meetings. 60 . A. Real-time fault monitoring for network devices and connections often relies on SNMP and ICMP-based monitoring capabilities. Netflow and syslog are more commonly used for diagnostic and analysis tasks. 61 . A. VLAN hopping between the voice and computer VLANs can be accomplished when devices share the same switch infrastructure. Using physically separate switches can prevent this attack. Encryption won't help with VLAN hopping because it relies on header data that the switch needs to read (and this is unencrypted), while Caller ID spoofing is an inherent problem with VoIP systems. A denial of service is always a possibility, but it isn't specifically a VoIP issue, and a firewall may not stop the problem if it's on a port that must be allowed through. 62 . A, B, D. RFC 1918 defines three address ranges as private (nonroutable) IP address ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. Any of these would work, but many organizations use the 192.168.0.0/16 range for smaller sites or opt to carve out sections of the 10.0.0.0/8 range for multiple remote sites. 63 . B. A captive portal is a popular solution that you may be familiar with from hotels and coffee shops. They combine the ability to gather data from customers with an open network, so customer data will not be encrypted. This avoids the need to distribute network passwords but means that customers must ensure their own traffic is encrypted if they are worried about security. 64 . C. A UPS system, or uninterruptible power supply, is designed to provide backup power during brief power disruptions ranging from power sags and brownouts to temporary power failures. For a longer outage, Susan will still want a generator or even a secondary power feed from another power grid or provider if possible, but for this specific scenario, a UPS will meet her needs. Dual power supplies help when the concern is losing power from one power supply and would be a great idea for her most critical network devices, but it is rare to have dual power supplies for edge devices like access points or edge switches. 65 . B. Fiber-optic cable is best suited to running 100 gigabit speeds. Cat5e, Cat6, and coaxial cable are not rated to those speeds. 66 . A. Data streams are associated with the Application, Presentation, and Session layers. Once they reach the Transport layer, they become segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP). From there, they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link layer, and bits at the Physical layer. 67 . C. If the devices still need to be in production but cannot be patched, Lucca's best option is to use a separate security device to protect them. It may be tempting to simply install a firewall on the device or to disable all the services it exposes to the network, but some devices may not have firewall software available, and even if they do, the underlying operating system may have vulnerabilities in its implementation of its network stack or other software that even a firewall could not protect. Unplugging devices that are needed for protection does not resolve the need to keep them online. 68 . C. Software-defined networking provides a network architecture that can be defined and configured as code or software and separates routing processes from packet switching while centralizing control. The 5-4-3 rule is an old design rule for networks that relied on repeaters or hubs. A converged network carries multiple types of traffic like voice, video, and data. A hypervisor-based network may be software defined, but it could also use traditional network devices running as virtual machines. 69 . A. Encapsulation adds to the header (and sometimes to the footer) of the data provided by the previous layer. The main body of the data is not modified, and encryption may happen but does not always happen. 70 . D. A broken network cable is a layer 1 problem. If you encounter a problem like this and aren't sure, look for the answer that has a different situation or set of assumptions. Here you have three questions that occur at the network (layer 3), all of which have software or protocol implications. A broken network cable is a completely different type of issue and should stand out. Be careful, though! The exam is likely to give you two potentially valid answers to choose from, so work to get rid of the two least likely answers and spend your time on the remaining options. 71 . D. Network segmentation can reduce issues with performance as well as diminish the chance of broadcast storms by limiting the number of systems in a segment. This decreases broadcast traffic visible to each system and can reduce congestion. Segmentation can also help provide security by separating functional groups that don't need to be able to access each other's systems. Installing a firewall at the border would only help with inbound and outbound traffic, not cross-network traffic. Spanning tree loop prevention helps prevent loops in Ethernet networks (for example, when you plug a switch into a switch via two ports on each), but it won't solve broadcast storms that aren't caused by a loop or security issues. Encryption might help prevent some problems between functional groups, but it won't stop them from scanning other systems, and it definitely won't stop a broadcast storm! 72 . B. Bandwidth describes the maximum amount of data that can be sent via a connection or network in a given period of time, and throughput describes the actual amount of traffic that is sent via the network or connection in a given period of time. The terms are not interchangeable but are closely related. 73 . D. In an IaaS environment, the company that provides the cloud environment has final control of all the virtual machines and networks. Thus, to protect data, the best option is to encrypt the data. Unfortunately, Ben cannot fully ensure that traffic in his environment is not being captured and must rely on the cloud hosting provider for that assurance. While preventing the installation of packet sniffers and taps and ensuring that promiscuous mode cannot be enabled are useful habits in an environment that you control, this will not provide the same control in a cloud environment. 74 . A. Using the same IP range for an on-site and cloud-hosted data center can be helpful when designing a flat network, but addresses must be carefully managed and allocated even in a space as big as the 10.0.0.0/24 range. If addresses are not properly managed, conflicts may arise that could disrupt production services. MAC address conflicts should not arise unless addresses are manually changed or virtual machines are replicated without changing their MAC addresses. There is nothing in the problem to suggest routing issues. 75 . C. A software-defined wide area network, or SD-WAN, is commonly used to manage multiple ISPs and other connectivity options to ensure speed, reliability, and bandwidth design goals are all met. Ben can use SD-WAN 144/220 capabilities to accomplish his goals to make his hybrid cloud environment successful. Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) is a storage protocol; VXLAN is used for extensible virtual LANs, not WANs; and LiFi uses visible and infrared light to transfer data. 76 . B. Traffic entering and leaving a network is often called north/south traffic. East/west traffic is traffic between systems inside of a network. Foreign/domestic is not a commonly used term, and trusted/untrusted cannot be determined without additional information. 77 . A. CXL, or Compute Express Link, is a converged protocol that is an open standard for high-speed communications with accelerators, GPUs, CPUs, and similar devices. VoIP is a telephony protocol, CDNs are content distribution networks, and iSCSI is a converged storage protocol. 78 . D. Fiber-optic cable is the most difficult of the listed types of network to capture data from without specialized equipment. Given access to a fiber-optic cable and specialized equipment to tap it, or with access to the endpoints of a fiber-optic cable and an optical tap, access can still be obtained. In either case, disruption may be observed when the cable is cut, spliced, or disconnected, and many attackers will not have access, skills, or the tools needed to do so. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth traffic can be captured using standard wireless cards and tools, and data carried by twisted-pair Ethernet cables is easily captured using commodity tools. 79 . C. Buried fiber-optic cable is best suited to long distances, particularly when there are trees or other obstacles blocking line of sight that may interfere with Wi-Fi or LiFi deployments. Ethernet's distance limitations mean that repeaters would need to be powered, and there is no description of other structures or power along the path. 80 . B. Endpoint security solutions face challenges due to the sheer volume of data that they can create. When each workstation is generating data about events, this can be a massive amount of data. Endpoint security solutions should reduce the number of compromises when properly implemented, and they can also help by monitoring traffic after it is decrypted on the local host. Finally, non-TCP protocols are relatively uncommon on modern networks, making this a relatively rare concern for endpoint security system implementations. 81 . D. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a loopback address and will resolve to the local machine. Public addresses are non–RFC 1918, nonreserved addresses. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved and include ranges like 10.x.x.x. An APIPA address is a self-assigned address used when a DHCP server cannot be found. 82 . B. Since Bluetooth doesn't provide strong encryption, it should only be used for activities that are not confidential. Bluetooth PINs are four-digit codes that often default to 0000. Turning it off and ensuring that your devices are not in discovery mode can help prevent Bluetooth attacks. 83 . C. The assignment of endpoint systems to VLANs is normally performed by a network switch. 84 . C. Infiniband over Ethernet is commonly used for purposes like this, allowing direct memory access over Ethernet while providing high bandwidth and low latency. iSCSI is used for storage, VoIP is used for telephony, and Compute Express Link (CXL) is used for CPU to device and CPU to memory connections. 85 . A, B, C. SD-WAN implementations typically perform all of these functions, combining active data collection via monitoring and response via self-learning and machine intelligence techniques and then applying predefined rules to take action to make the network perform as desired. SD-WAN does not imply or require that all connections are managed by the organization's primary Internet service provider. In fact, SD-WANs are often used to handle multiple ISPs to allow for failover and redundancy. 86 . B. The OSI layers in order from layer 1 to layer 7 are as follows: 1 . Physical 2 . Data Link 3 . Network 4 . Transport 5 . Session 6 . Presentation 7 . Application 87 . C. Valerie is most likely trying to prevent content addressable memory (CAM) table or MAC address table flooding by preventing large numbers of MAC addresses from being used on a single port. If CAM table flooding is successful, switches will not know where to send traffic and resort to sending all traffic to every port, potentially exposing traffic to attackers. IP spoofing and VLAN hopping are not prevented by port security, which focuses on hardware (MAC) addresses. MAC aggregation was made up for this question. 88 . C. A pre-admit, client-based NAC system will test systems before they are allowed on the network using a client that can determine more about a system than a clientless model can. Postadmission tests after clients are already on the network and clientless versions are useful when installing clients isn't possible for systems. 89 . A. An active/active pair can use the full throughput capability of both devices, but normal deployment models will design to the maximum throughput of a single device to avoid disruption in the event that one of the pair fails. Active/passive designs can only handle the throughput of a single device and allow the secondary device to remain ready to operate but not passing traffic until it is needed. Line interactive is a term often used to describe UPS systems that filter power instead of passing it through, and near-line is a term used to describe backups that are not online but can be retrieved relatively quickly. 90 . A. A VPN that allows access to secured VLANs is the most common security design for this type of infrastructure. This allows secured remote access while protecting IoT devices that are often unable to be properly secured and thus cannot be trusted on a more exposed network. IPS does not provide remote access, and private IP addresses alone do not provide a protected network. DLP is used to prevent data exfiltration and won't stop other attacks or provide remote management access. iSCSI is a storage protocol, not a security solution. A VPN and jump boxes are useful, but the devices would not be provided with additional security by iSCSi. 91 . D. Most existing satellite internet systems have relatively high latency. Newer low Earth orbit satellites like Starlink appear to provide better latency than higher orbits, but latency and susceptibility to interference from weather are both common concerns for satellite-based systems. 92 . C. The application plane of a software-defined network (SDN) is where applications run that use application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate with the SDN about needed resources. The control plane receives instructions and sends them to the network. The last common plane is the data plane, which forwards devices handling data and takes inputs from the control plane. The monitoring plane is not a common layer in an SDN environment. 93 . B. Common drawbacks of multilayer protocols are that they can bypass filters, allow or create covert channels, and allow network segment boundaries to be bypassed. The ability to operate at higher OSI layer levels is 145/220 normally considered a benefit. 94 . C. In order, the layers are Application layer, Transport layer, Internet layer, and Network Access layer. 95 . B. Content distribution networks are used to both improve performance and reduce the impacts of denial-ofservice attacks. Load-balanced server clusters may be part of the underlying design, but a CDN will more completely address Aadita's needs at the scale described. Micro-segmentation is used to isolate systems and services, not to address multiregion content accessibility and denial-of-service issues. A VPC may be part of a solution, but nothing about a VPC makes it a sufficient solution on its own. 96 . B, C. 5G technology includes both a new mutual authentication capability and additional protections for subscriber identities. It does not have specific anti-jamming security features and does not specifically use multifactor authentication. 97 . C. Virtual eXtensible LAN (VXLAN) tunnels layer 2 connections over a layer 3 network, in essence extending a LAN over distances or networks that it might not otherwise function over. It does not remove the distance limitations of Ethernet cables, nor does it allow multiple subnets to use the same IP space—that requires NAT or other technologies that remap addresses to avoid conflicts. 98 . B. VLANs can be used to logically separate groups of network ports while still providing access to an uplink. Per-room VPNs would create significant overhead for support as well as create additional expenses. Port security is used to limit what systems can connect to ports, but it doesn't provide network security between systems. Finally, while firewalls might work, they would add expense and complexity without adding any benefits over a VLAN solution. 99 . D. MAC addresses and their organizationally unique identifiers are used at the Data Link layer to identify systems on a network. The Application and Session layers don't care about physical addresses, while the Physical layer involves electrical connectivity and handling physical interfaces rather than addressing. 100 . C. This diagram shows the use of the Session Initialization Protocol (SIP) instead of SIP Secure (SIPS), meaning that SIP is not encrypted. Fortunately, the voice data via the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is encrypted. Mikayla should look into using SIPS in addition to SRTP. 101 . D. Air-gaps are physical separations between systems or devices that prevent communications or connections between them. This prevents network-based attacks and limits the ways that attackers could access the devices. Store-and-forward stores communications and send them after checking for errors. In-band administration occurs over existing interfaces or connections; out-of-band administration uses a separate network or management interface. Chapter 5: Identity and Access Management (Domain 5) 1 . B. Single sign-on provides a single authentication process to allow authorization to multiple services. An access control list, or ACL, is a ruleset used to determine if a subject can gain access to a service or system. Multifactor requires multiple factors, and the specifics of how Henry logged in were not discussed in the question. Finally, role-based access control uses a subject's role(s) to determine if they can access a service or system, and no mention of roles was made. 2 . B. Since Jim's organization is using a cloud-based identity as a service solution, a third-party, on-premises identity service can provide the ability to integrate with the IDaaS solution, and the company's use of Active Directory is widely supported by third-party vendors. OAuth is used to log in to third-party websites using existing credentials and would not meet the needs described. SAML is a markup language and would not meet the full set of AAA needs. Since the organization is using Active Directory, a custom in-house solution is unlikely to be as effective as a preexisting third-party solution and may take far more time and expense to implement. 3 . D. A policy enforcement point in a zero trust environment receives authorization requests and then sends them to the policy decision point. They are used anywhere that authorization controls are needed. They do not make decisions for the policy engine, can exist beyond workstations and mobile devices, and use policies set at the zero trust control layer rather than just at the endpoint device. 4 . C. Voice pattern recognition is “something you are,” a biometric authentication factor, because it measures a physical characteristic of the individual authenticating. 5 . B. Susan has used two distinct types of factors: the PIN and password are both Type 1 factors, and the retina scan is a Type 3 factor. Her username is not a factor. 6 . C. Hardware Security Modules, or HSMs, are the most secure way to store keys associated with a CMS. They provide enhanced key management capabilities and are often required to be FIPS certified. In addition to these advantages, an HSM can improve cryptographic performance for the organization due to dedicated hardware designed for just that purpose. Long keys and using AES-256 are good practices, but an HSM provides greater security and will require appropriate cryptographic controls already. Changing passphrases can be challenging across an organization; instead, securing the passphrases and keys is more important and reasonable for most organizations. 7 . B. Brian's organization is using a federated identity management approach where multiple organizations allow identities to be used across the organizations. Each organization needs to conduct identity proofing of their own staff members' identities and provide them with rights and role information that will allow them to use resources within the federated identity environment. 8 . A. Authentication that takes attributes such as location, device, and time of day into account is context-aware authentication. This allows organizations to make choices about whether the authentication is appropriate and allowed in addition to the use of credentials. The decision is based on contextual information, not user knowledge or identity factors, which are used only to authenticate. Zero trust may leverage context information, but context-aware authentication alone does not indicate zero trust. 9 . B. Decentralized access control can result in less consistency because the individuals tasked with control may interpret policies and requirements differently and may perform their roles in different ways. Access outages, overly granular control, and training costs may occur, depending on specific implementations, but they are not commonly identified issues with decentralized access control. 10 . B. A callback to a landline phone number is an example of a “somewhere you are” factor because of the fixed physical location of a wired phone. A callback to a mobile phone would be a “something you have” factor. 11 . B. The NIST recommendation to not expire passwords recognizes that users often make minimal changes to their passwords when they are required to change them. In addition, password changes drive significant support 146/220 overhead as users forget their passwords or otherwise face challenges with them. Longer password lives do create the potential for attackers to have longer to compromise them, but modern password recommendations look for multifactor authentication, which means a compromised password is less of a threat. Hashing new passwords does require computation, but not a significant amount using modern hardware. 12 . C. AAA refers to a set of security protocols that are used to identify and authorize users and record their activities. The acronym stands for authentication, authorization, and accounting. 13 . A. Active Directory relies on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) as part of its single sign-on (SSO) implementation. Zero trust is not a SSO implementation, and Shibboleth is an open-source identity management system. RADIUS is not a single sign-on implementation, although some vendors use it behind the scenes to provide authentication for proprietary SSO. 14 . B. Knowledge-based authentication relies on information that only the individual who wants to prove their identity is likely to know. This might include a mortgage payment amount, vehicle information, or driver's license number among many options. Cognitive passwords, or security questions, are created by users, which means they aren't suited to this type of identity proofing. Palm scans and USB tokens both require prior engagement with the user as well and thus aren't suited for identity proofing with users who are new customers. 15 . D. When the owner of a file makes the decisions about who has rights or access privileges to it, they are using discretionary access control. Role-based access controls would grant access based on a subject's role, while rule-based controls would base the decision on a set of rules or requirements. Nondiscretionary access controls apply a fixed set of rules to an environment to manage access. Nondiscretionary access controls include rule-, role-, and lattice-based access controls. 16 . D. Need to know is applied when subjects like Alex have access to only the data they need to accomplish their job. Separation of duties is used to limit fraud and abuse by having multiple employees perform parts of a task. Constrained interfaces restrict what a user can see or do and would be a reasonable answer if need to know did not describe his access more completely in this scenario. Context-dependent control relies on the activity being performed to apply controls, and this question does not specify a workflow or process. 17 . D. Password history tracks what passwords have been set previously and will not allow reuse. A specific number of past passwords is typically set, and passwords themselves should not be retained. Instead, properly secured hashes are retained and compared to hashes of the new passwords. Length, maximum age, and MFA do not solve the issue of password reuse. 18 . C. Ifeoma knows that a minimum password age of one day will discourage users from resetting their passwords to attempt to return to their original password. Length and complexity do not prevent this if the original password met these requirements, and a maximum age is set in organizations that require password changes on a recurring basis. 19 . A. Requiring multifactor authentication (MFA) is a common security measure used to prevent unauthorized access to an account in case of password loss or exposure. SSO allows the use of an account throughout systems or services. Federation connects different organizations together, allowing the use of credentials between trusted partners, and password rotation can help, but lost passwords remain dangerous until the rotation happens allowing days, weeks, or even months of potential vulnerable time. 20 . A. Retina scans can reveal additional information, including high blood pressure and pregnancy, causing privacy concerns. Newer retina scans don't require a puff of air, and retina scanners are not the most expensive biometric factor. Their false positive rate can typically be adjusted in software, allowing administrators to adjust their acceptance rate as needed to balance usability and security. 21 . C. Mandatory access control systems are based on a lattice-based model. Lattice-based models use a matrix of classification labels to compartmentalize data. Discretionary access models allow object owners to determine access to the objects they control, role-based access controls are often group-based, and rule-based access controls like firewall ACLs apply rules to all subjects they apply to. 22 . D. Using an enterprise authentication system like Active Directory that requires individuals to log in with their credentials provides the ability to determine who was logged in if a problem occurs and also allows Greg to quickly and easily remove users who are terminated or switch roles. Using a shared PIN provides no accountability, while unique PINs per user on specifically issued iPads mean that others will not be able to log in. OAuth alone does not provide the services and features Greg needs—it is an authorization service, not an authentication service. 23 . A. Logging systems can provide accountability for identity systems by tracking the actions, changes, and other activities a user or account performs. Authorization does not provide accountability because it validates that a person can perform an action, not who is using the identity. Digital signatures can be used to validate an identity, not to provide accountability by proving who is using it, and Type 1 authentication is something you know. Again, logging is the best way to provide accountability for the use of an identity. 24 . B. As an employee's role changes, they often experience privilege creep, which is the accumulation of old rights and roles. Account review is the process of reviewing accounts and ensuring that their rights match their owners' role and job requirements. Account revocation removes accounts, while re-provisioning might occur if an employee was terminated and returned or took a leave of absence and returned. 25 . A. Biba uses a lattice to control access and is a form of the mandatory access control (MAC) model. It does not use rules, roles, or attributes, nor does it allow user discretion. Users can create content at their level or lower but cannot decide who gets access, levels are not roles, and attributes are not used to make decisions on access control. 26 . C. RADIUS is an AAA protocol used to provide authentication and authorization; it's often used for modems, wireless networks, and network devices. It uses network access servers to send access requests to central RADIUS servers. Kerberos is a ticket-based authentication protocol; OAuth is an open standard for authentication allowing the use of credentials from one site on third-party sites; and EAP is the Extensible Authentication Protocol, an authentication framework often used for wireless networks. 27 . A. Session identifiers should not be predictable to ensure that attackers can't simply guess or easily brute force session IDS. Web application development best practices currently recommend the use of long session IDs (128 bits or longer) that have sufficient entropy (randomness) to ensure that they will not be easily duplicated or brute-forced. It is also a best practice to make sure the session ID itself is meaningless to prevent information disclosure attacks. Session IDs should expire, however, because a session that never expires could eventually be brute-forced even if all of these recommendations were met. 28 . B. Passwordless authentication leverages applications and capabilities such as built-in biometric authentication 147/220 mechanisms. Extended and alternative authentication are not terms used on the exam. The Fast Identity Online Alliance (FIDO) is an open industry association that provides frameworks for passwordless authentication, but SPOT is not a type of passwordless authentication. 29 . B. The posturing capability of network access control (NAC) determines if a system is sufficiently secure and compliant enough to connect to a network. This is a form of risk-based access control, as systems that are not compliant are considered higher risk and either are placed in a quarantine and remediation network or zone or are prohibited from connecting to the network until they are compliant. 30 . D. Authorization provides a user with capabilities or rights. Roles and group management are both methods that could be used to match users with rights. Logins are used to validate a user. 31 . C. Privilege creep occurs when users retain rights they do not need to accomplish their current job from roles they held previously. Unauthorized access occurs when an unauthorized user accesses files. Excessive provisioning is not a term used to describe permissions issues, and account review would help find issues like this. 32 . A. Multifactor authentication is most likely to limit horizontal privilege escalation by making it difficult to access user accounts and to authenticate to a compromised account. Limiting permissions for groups and accounts can also help, but disabling unused ports and services and sanitizing user inputs both address threats that are most frequently associated with vertical privilege escalation attacks. 33 . C. Hybrid systems use both on-premises and cloud identity and services to provide resources and tools in both environments. While they can be complex, hybrid systems also provide a migration path to a full cloud deployment or for a fault-tolerant design that can handle on-premises or cloud outages while remaining functional. 34 . C. Mandatory access controls (MAC) use a lattice or matrix to describe how classification labels relate to each other. In this image, classification levels are set for each of the labels shown. A discretionary access control (DAC) system would show how the owner of the objects allows access. RBAC could be either rule- or rolebased access control and would use either system-wide rules or roles. Task-based access control (TBAC) would list tasks for users. 35 . D. Copying existing rights to new groups that have different needs will often result in overly broad privileges. Michelle should create new groups, move all staff into the appropriate groups, and then ensure that they have the access and permissions they need. 36 . B. The process of a subject claiming or professing an identity is known as identification. Authorization verifies the identity of a subject by checking a factor like a password. Logins typically include both identification and authorization, and token presentation is a type of authentication. 37 . A. Service accounts are commonly set to not have expiring passwords to prevent service outages. Organizations may choose to rotate passwords on a regular basis using automation tools as part of their password management strategy to help avoid issues with exposed or compromised service passwords. Disabling complexity requirements and setting a minimum password age are not commonly done for service accounts. 38 . B. Password complexity is driven by length, and a longer password will be more effective against brute-force attacks than a shorter password. Each character of additional length increases the difficulty by the size of the potential character set (for example, a single lowercase character makes the passwords 26 times more difficult to crack). While each of the other settings is useful for a strong password policy, they won't have the same impact on brute-force attacks. 39 . A. Interactive login for a service account is a critical warning sign, either of compromise or bad administrative practices. In either case, Alaina should immediately work to determine why the account logged in, what occurred, and if the interactive login was done remotely or locally. A remote interactive login for a service account in any professionally maintained environment is an almost guaranteed sign of compromise. Password changes for service accounts may be done as part of ongoing password expiration processes, limitations should always be placed on service accounts rights to ensure that they are only those required, and a local use of the service account as part of the service is a normal event. 40 . A. Organizations that have very strict security requirements that don't have a tolerance for false acceptance want to lower the false acceptance rate, or FAR, to be as near to zero as possible. That often means that the false rejection rate, or FRR, increases. Different biometric technologies or a better registration method can help improve biometric performance, but false rejections due to data quality are not typically a concern with modern biometric systems. In this case, knowing the crossover error rate, or CER, or having a very high CER doesn't help the decision. 41 . C. The most efficient use of Derek's time would be to create a group that is populated with all maintenance staff and then to give that group login rights only to the designated PCs. While time-based constraints might help, in this case, it would continue to allow maintenance staff to log in to PCs that are not intended for use during business hours, leaving a gap in the control. Multifactor authentication, as described, does not meet the requirements of the scenario but may be a good idea overall for greater security for authentication across the organization. Geofencing is typically not accurate enough to rely on inside buildings for specific PCs. 42 . B, C. Common session management techniques include the use of cookies, hidden form fields, URL rewriting, and built-in frameworks like Java's HTTPS session. IP tracking may be included in session information but is not itself a complete session identifier, and TLS token binding is used to make TLS sessions more secure, not to provide session identification. 43 . C. TLS provides message confidentiality and integrity, which can prevent eavesdropping. When paired with digital signatures, which provide integrity and authentication, forged assertions can also be defeated. SAML does not have a security mode and relies on TLS and digital signatures to ensure security if needed. Message hashing without a signature would help prevent modification of the message but won't necessarily provide authentication. 44 . B. Integration with cloud-based third parties that rely on local authentication can fail if the local organization's Internet connectivity or servers are offline. Adopting a hybrid cloud and local authentication system can ensure that Internet or server outages are handled, allowing authentication to work regardless of where the user is or if their home organization is online. Using encrypted and signed communication does not address availability, redirects are a configuration issue with the third party, and a local gateway won't handle remote users. Also, host files don't help with availability issues with services other than DNS. 45 . A. While many solutions are technical, if a trusted third party redirects to an unexpected authentication site, 148/220 awareness is often the best defense. Using TLS would keep the transaction confidential but would not prevent the redirect. Handling redirects locally works only for locally hosted sites, and using a third-party service requires off-site redirects. An IPS might detect an attacker's redirect, but tracking the multitude of load-balanced servers most large providers use can be challenging, if not impossible. In addition, an IPS relies on visibility into the traffic, and SAML integrations should be encrypted for security, which would require a man-in-the-middle type of IPS to be configured. 46 . B. Discretionary access control (DAC) can provide greater scalability by leveraging many administrators, and those administrators can add flexibility by making decisions about access to their objects without fitting into an inflexible mandatory access control system (MAC). MAC is more secure due to the strong set of controls it provides, but it does not scale as well as DAC and is relatively inflexible in comparison. 47 . C. While signature-based detection is used to detect attacks, review of provisioning processes typically involves checking logs, reviewing the audit trail, or performing a manual review of permissions granted during the provisioning process. 48 . A. SAML is an open, XML-based standard used to provide authorization, attribute information, and authentication data. SOAP, or Simple Object Access Protocol, is a messaging protocol and could be used for any XML messaging but is not a markup language itself. OAuth is an authorization framework that exchanges information using APIs, and OpenID Connect is an authentication layer using OAuth that provides both authentication and authorization, but not attribute information. 49 . C. Rainbow tables are databases of pre-hashed passwords paired with high-speed lookup functions. Since they can quickly compare known hashes against those in a file, using rainbow tables is the fastest way to quickly determine passwords from hashes. A brute-force attack may eventually succeed but will be very slow against most hashes. Pass-the-hash attacks rely on sniffed or otherwise acquired NTLM or LanMan hashes being sent to a system to avoid the need to know a user's password. Salts are data added to a hash to avoid the use of tools like rainbow tables. A salt added to a password means the hash won't match a rainbow table generated without the same salt. 50 . B. Google's federation with other applications and organizations allows single sign-on as well as management of their electronic identity and its related attributes. While this is an example of SSO, it goes beyond simple single sign-on. Provisioning provides accounts and rights, and a public key infrastructure is used for certificate management. 51 . D. When users have more rights than they need to accomplish their job, they have excessive privileges. This is a violation of the concept of least privilege. Unlike privilege creep, this is a provisioning or rights management issue rather than a problem of retention of rights the user needed but no longer requires. Rights collision is a made-up term and thus is not an issue here. 52 . B. Registration is the process of adding a user to an identity management system. This includes creating their unique identifier and adding any attribute information that is associated with their identity. Proofing occurs when the user provides information to prove who they are. Directories are managed to maintain lists of users, services, and other items. Session management tracks application and user sessions. 53 . A, B. Audit logging when combined with user accounts that can reliably be expected to be accessible only to a specific user due to the use of multifactor authentication is frequently used to provide strong accountability for actions taken via systems and applications. A password can be shared, making it less reliable, and time and location requirements are useful security controls but do not impact accountability. 54 . D. OAuth is the most widely used open standard for authorization and delegation of rights for cloud services. OpenID is used for authentication, and TACACS+ and RADIUS are primarily used on-site for authentication and authorization for network devices. 55 . D. Cameron is using a just-in-time (JIT) system that provides the access needed when it is needed. A zero trust system requires authentication and authorization when actions are performed but does not necessarily require privileges to be granted and removed when they are needed. 56 . C. Identity proofing can be done by comparing user information that the organization already has, like account numbers or personal information. Requiring users to create unique questions can help with future support by providing a way for them to do password resets. Using a phone call only verifies that the individual who created the account has the phone that they registered and won't prove their identity. In-person verification would not fit the business needs of most websites. 57 . A. In federated systems, a user's access to services is authenticated through their own organization's identity provider (IDP). Service providers query those IDPs when the user attempts to authenticate to the service and, if the request is validated, allow access based on the rules and policies set for the service based on attributes that may be relevant that are provided by the IDP. 58 . C. Type 2 errors occur in biometric systems when an invalid subject is incorrectly authenticated as a valid user. In this case, nobody except the actual customer should be validated when fingerprints are scanned. Type 1 errors occur when a valid subject is not authenticated; if the existing customer is rejected, it is a Type 1 error. Registration is the process of adding users, but registration errors and time of use, method of use errors are not specific biometric authentication terms. 59 . B. Firewalls use rule-based access control, or Rule-BAC, in their access control lists and apply rules created by administrators to all traffic that passes through them. DAC, or discretionary access control, allows owners to determine who can access objects they control, while task-based access control lists tasks for users. MAC, or mandatory access control, uses classifications to determine access. 60 . C. When you input a username and password, you are authenticating yourself by providing a unique identifier and a verification that you are the person who should have that identifier (the password). Authorization is the process of determining what a user is allowed to do. Validation and login both describe elements of what is happening in the process; however, they aren't the most important identity and access management activity. 61 . C. Kathleen should implement a biometric factor. The cards and keys are an example of a Type 2 factor, or “something you have.” Using a smart card replaces this with another Type 2 factor, but the cards could still be loaned out or stolen. Adding a PIN would address the problem by adding a second authentication factor, but PINs may be written down and are prone to theft or even guessing for shorter PINs, so a biometric factor is preferable if it is available. Adding cameras doesn't prevent access to the facility and thus doesn't solve the immediate problem (but it is a good idea!). 62 . C. Enterprise credential management tools, often called password vaults, allow passwords to be securely generated, stored, and managed. They can provide logs of who uses passwords, when they were updated, and 149/220 if they meet complexity and other requirements. Of course, this means the keys to your environment are all in one place, so securing and managing the enterprise password manager is very important! 63 . B. The sudoers file can list the specific users who can use sudo as well as the commands or directories that are allowed for them. 64 . C. In a mandatory access control system, all subjects and objects have a label. Compartments may or may not be used, but there is not a specific requirement for either subjects or objects to be compartmentalized. The specific labels of Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret are not required by MAC. 65 . D. Passwords are never stored for web applications in a well-designed environment. Instead, salted hashes are stored and compared to passwords after they are salted and hashed. If the hashes match, the user is authenticated. 66 . C. When a third-party site integrates via OAuth 2.0, authentication is handled by the service provider's servers. In this case, Google is acting as the service provider for user authentication. Authentication for local users who create their own accounts would occur in the e-commerce application (or a related server), but that is not the question that is asked here. 67 . B. The anti-forgery state token exchanged during OAuth sessions is intended to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This makes sure that the unique session token with the authentication response from Google's OAuth service is available to verify that the user, not an attacker, is making a request. XSS attacks focus on scripting and would have script tags involved, SQL injection would have SQL code included, and XACML is the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language, not a type of attack. 68 . A. Knowledge-based authentication relies on preset questions such as “What is your pet's name?” and the answers. It can be susceptible to attacks because of the availability of the answers on social media or other sites. Dynamic knowledge-based authentication relies on facts or data that the user already knows that can be used to create questions they can answer on an as-needed basis (for example, a previous address or a school they attended). Out-of-band identity proofing relies on an alternate channel like a phone call or text message. Finally, Type 3 authentication factors are biometric, or “something you are,” rather than knowledge-based. 69 . C. An access control matrix is a table that lists objects, subjects, and their privileges. Access control lists focus on objects and which subjects can access them. Capability tables list subjects and what objects they can access. Subject/object rights management systems are not based on an access control model. 70 . C. Self-service password reset tools typically have a significant impact on the number of password reset contacts that a help desk has. Two-factor and biometric authentication both add complexity and may actually increase the number of contacts. Passphrases can be easier to remember than traditional complex passwords and may decrease calls, but they don't have the same impact that a self-service system does. 71 . C. RADIUS supports TLS over TCP. RADIUS does not have a supported TLS mode over UDP. AES preshared symmetric ciphers are not a supported solution and would be difficult to both implement and maintain in a large environment, and the built-in encryption in RADIUS only protects passwords. 72 . B. OAuth provides the ability to access resources from another service and would meet Jim's needs. OpenID would allow him to use an account from another service with his application, and Kerberos and LDAP are used more frequently for in-house services. 73 . B. Since physical access to the workstations is part of the problem, setting application timeouts and passwordprotected screensavers with relatively short inactivity timeouts can help prevent unauthorized access. Using session IDs for all applications and verifying system IP addresses would be helpful for online attacks against applications. 74 . A. This diagram shows an example of hybrid federation where authentication occurs on-premises and services are provided through a federated identity service in the cloud. 75 . B, C. The best answers in the scenario that Chris faces are either RFID or magstripe readers and PIN pads. Guards create ongoing expenses, and any solution without a PIN will allow a stolen or cloned badge to be used without validating that the person accessing the building is a legitimate user. While a guard can prevent a stolen badge and PIN combination, this is only used in environments where the cost is justifiable. 76 . A. Yubikeys, Titan Security Keys, and similar devices are examples of tokens. PIV stands for personal identity verification and is a full multifactor authentication solution, not a device. Biometric identifiers are something you are, and a smart card is a card with an embedded chip. 77 . C. OpenID Connect is a RESTful, JSON-based authentication protocol that, when paired with OAuth, can provide identity verification and basic profile information. SAML is the Security Assertion Markup Language, Shibboleth is a federated identity solution designed to allow web-based SSO, and Higgins is an open-source project designed to provide users with control over the release of their identity information. 78 . C. In a mandatory access control system, the operating system enforces access control, and users cannot delegate rights. Discretionary access control allows users to delegate rights, and neither attribute nor role-based access control specifically meets these requirements. 79 . D. In a zero trust reference model-based design, subjects connect through a policy enforcement point. The policy engine makes policy decisions based on rules that are then acted on by the policy administrator, granting or denying access to enterprise resources. Constrained interfaces limit user actions but are not the component connected through to conduct transactions. 80 . C. Synchronous soft tokens, such as Google Authenticator, use a time-based algorithm that generates a constantly changing series of codes. Asynchronous tokens typically require a challenge to be entered on the token to allow it to calculate a response, which the server compares to the response it expects. Smartcards typically present a certificate but may have other token capabilities built-in. Static tokens are physical devices that can contain credentials and include smart cards and memory cards. 81 . B. Kerberos, RADIUS, and TACACS+ are all commonly used for internal networks. SENTRY was made up for this question. 82 . B. Knowledge-based authentication is used by some financial institutions to validate the identity of new users. It uses information from tax and financial records that is unlikely to be available to others, allowing new users to provide details like their last credit card payment, mortgage payment, or other information to validate their identity. A Social Security number is somewhat trivial to acquire via paid services or other means, and manually validating identities is neither quick nor automatic. A biometric factor would require a previous enrollment, making this unsuitable for new customers. 83 . B, C. Google accounts, like many cloud identity providers, rely on OpenID and OAuth. Kerberos is used for onpremises environments, and RADIUS is frequently used for authentication and authorization for network devices 150/220 and services like VPN. 84 . C. Best practices for session management involve a long session ID (often 128 bits or longer) and enough randomness or entropy to make it hard to guess session IDs. This makes brute-force or algorithmic guessing attacks unlikely unless there is a flaw in the implementation. These do not prevent denial-of-service or man-inthe-middle attacks, and cookie attacks are focused on acquiring and reading or reusing cookies in most scenarios. 85 . D. Risk-based access control models risk using information that is available when the access request is created. Information about the request and the risk it may create is calculated based on risk values and compared to access policies. If the risk value is acceptable, access is granted. One of the most common examples of this in organizations is NAC, or network access control, where a system is profiled to determine security risk and compliance before admission to a network. This can be seen as a more specific example of rule-based access control. Role-based access control bases its decisions on the roles of the individuals, whereas mandatory access control is enforced by the operating system. 86 . A. The most important step in securing service accounts is to ensure that they have only the rights that are absolutely needed to accomplish the task they are designed for. Disabling interactive logins is important as well and would be the next best answer. Limiting when accounts can log in and using randomized or meaningless account names can both be helpful in some circumstances but are far less important. 87 . B. The NIST zero trust reference design includes both the Policy Engine and the Policy Administrator as part of the policy decision point. The terms control plane module , enterprise management console , and zero trust engine are not used in this context. 88 . C. Federation does not necessarily guarantee that services will be shared or made accessible. Member organizations can choose which services they provide and can use more granular controls like role- or organization-based permissions to grant access to services. Payment may be part of a federation agreement or service access, but simply federating does not create or prevent a financial requirement. 89 . A. Attributes used for ABAC often fall into one of four categories: subject attributes such as department or title; action attributes such as the ability to view, edit, or delete; object attributes that describe the object that can be impacted; and contextual attributes such as location, time, or elements. Discretionary access control would place these decisions in the hands of trusted subjects, MAC would enforce it at the operating system level, and role BAC would use only roles instead of the full set of criteria Kristen wants to apply. 90 . D. The Linux filesystem allows the owners of objects to determine the access rights that subjects have to them. This means that it is a discretionary access control. If the system enforced a role-based access control, Alex wouldn't set the controls; they would be set based on the roles assigned to each subject. A rule-based access control system would apply rules throughout the system, and a mandatory access control system uses classification labels. 91 . B. Privilege creep is a constant concern when staff change roles over time. Privileges from previous roles may be easy to forget or to retain during transition because staff may continue to help cover the tasks or processes the individual previously performed. Over time, these forgotten rights and privileges can stack, leaving the staff member with rights that their current role should not have. Registration is a concern for new staff, while deprovisioning is a concern for departing staff. Accountability is typically provided by IAM systems by authenticating and logging access and privilege usage. 92 . A. This is a role-based access control (RBAC) chart noting that each group has specific rights by roles. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) would use other attributes including things like location, mandatory access control (MAC) would be enforced by the operating system, and discretionary access control (DAC) allows subjects like users to set rights on objects they control. 93 . A. Ensure that users cannot bypass logging by switching to the root user using sudo su - . Instead, users who need the ability to perform privileged actions should be added to the sudoers list and then logged as themselves performing the actions. Adding all users is likely an overly broad action, whereas removing all users would not allow individual logging under their accounts, nor would they have rights to take administrative actions. Disabling sudo doesn't allow administrative tasks except as root, which defeats this requirement as well. 94 . C. Single sign-on (SSO) is part of identity federation. It also means that account management is simpler since multiple accounts don't have to be maintained for users who need to access systems and resources across the federation. Productivity can increase because staff don't have to remember multiple logins and can use SSO to log in once instead of multiple times. It does not, however, do anything to prevent brute-force attacks, and in fact, a single account with broad access can make it easier for an attacker to gain that broader access unless solutions like multifactor authentication are put in place. 95 . A. A JIT, or just-in-time, provisioning mechanism creates accounts when they are needed rather than creating them in advance. This is an effective method to limit the number of accounts being maintained and can be useful if the number of accounts are part of a licensing agreement that may drive costs higher if users who don't need accounts or are not using them have them. OAuth, OpenID, and Kerberos are not mentioned in the question. 96 . B. Windows uses Kerberos for authentication. RADIUS is typically used for wireless networks, modems, and network devices, while OAuth is primarily used for web applications. TACACS+ is used for network devices. 97 . D. When very high levels of control are needed or when endpoint devices cannot be trusted, using a centralized environment with remote connectivity and enterprise authentication can provide appropriate security. 98 . 1 . E 2 . B 3 . D 4 . C 5 . A 99 . The security controls match with the categories as follows: 1 . Password: B. Something you know 2 . ID card: A. Something you have 3 . Retinal scan: C. Something you are 4 . Smartphone token: A. Something you have 5 . Fingerprint analysis: C. Something you are 100 . 1 . A 2 . E 151/220 3 . D 4 . B 5 . C Chapter 6: Security Assessment and Testing (Domain 6) 1 . B. TCP and UDP ports 137–139 are used for NetBIOS services, whereas 445 is used for Active Directory. TCP 1433 is the default port for Microsoft SQL, indicating that this is probably a Windows server providing SQL services. 2 . D. Mutation testing modifies a program in small ways and then tests that mutant to determine if it behaves as it should or if it fails. This technique is used to design and test software tests through mutation. Static code analysis and regression testing are both means of testing code, whereas code auditing is an analysis of source code rather than a means of designing and testing software tests. 3 . B. TCP port 443 normally indicates an HTTPS server. Nikto is useful for vulnerability scanning web servers and applications and is the best choice listed for a web server. Metasploit includes some scanning functionality but is not a purpose-built tool for vulnerability scanning. zzuf is a fuzzing tool and isn't relevant for vulnerability scans, whereas sqlmap is a SQL injection testing tool. 4 . A. Syslog is a widely used protocol for event and message logging. Eventlog, netlog, and Remote Log Protocol are all made-up terms. 5 . C. Fuzzers are tools designed to provide invalid or unexpected input to applications, testing for vulnerabilities like format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflow issues, and other problems. A static analysis relies on examining code without running the application or code and thus would not fill forms as part of a web application. Brute-force tools attempt to bypass security by trying every possible combination for passwords or other values. A black box is a type of penetration test where the testers do not know anything about the environment. 6 . B. OpenVAS is an open-source vulnerability scanning tool that will provide Susan with a report of the vulnerabilities that it can identify from a remote, network-based scan. Nmap is an open-source port scanner. Both the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and Nessus are closed-source tools, although Nessus was originally open source. 7 . B. CVSS, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, is used to describe the severity of security vulnerabilities. CCE is Common Configuration Enumeration, a naming system for configuration issues. CPE is Common Platform Enumeration, which names operating systems, applications, and devices. OVAL is a language for describing security testing procedures. 8 . C. Jim has agreed to a black-box penetration test, which provides no information about the organization, its systems, or its defenses. A crystal- or white-box penetration test provides all of the information an attacker needs, whereas a gray-box penetration test provides some, but not all, information. 9 . A. The key to answering this question correctly is understanding the difference between SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports, and Type I and Type II audits. SOC 1 reports cover financial reporting, and SOC 2 reports look at security. Type I audits cover only a single point in time and are based on management descriptions of controls. They do not include an assessment of operating effectiveness. Type II audits cover a period of time and include an assessment of operating effectiveness. 10 . B. WPA3 uses SAE, or simultaneous authentication of equals, and does not send the password over the air. Traditional cracking methods used against previous versions of WPA and WPA2 no longer work. This is not because of complex passwords or MFA, but because of how the handshake's elements are created to avoid sending the password. 11 . D. In many cases when an exploit is initially reported, there are no prebuilt signatures or detections for vulnerability scanners, and the CVE database may not immediately have information about the attack. Jacob's best option is to quickly gather information and review potentially vulnerable servers based on their current configuration. As more information becomes available, signatures and CVE information are likely to be published. Unfortunately for Jacob, IDS and IPS signatures will detect only attacks and won't detect whether systems are vulnerable unless he sees the systems being exploited. 12 . C. Interface testing is used to ensure that software modules properly meet interface specifications and thus will properly exchange data. Dynamic testing tests software in a running environment, whereas fuzzing is a type of dynamic testing that feeds invalid input to running software to test error and input handling. API checksums are not a testing technique. 13 . B. Using a third-party auditor from a well-known and well-regarded firm is often the best option when providing audit and compliance information to third parties. Selah could engage an appropriate vendor for a SOC 2 Type II engagement as one example of a reasonable option to provide detail to her customers. Internal staff assessing against a common standard like COBIT would be the next most acceptable option on this list, with an internal standard less useful than that. Finally, relying on internal personnel not specialized in audits proves to be the least effective strategy in this context. 14 . C. Breach and attack simulation (BAS) systems combine red team (attack) and blue team (defense) techniques together with automation to simulate advanced persistent threats and other advanced threat actors when run against your environment. This allows a variety of threats to be replicated and assessed in an environment without as much overhead as a fully staffed purple team would. 15 . D. Most organizations use surveys to assess security awareness. Phishing simulators are also frequently used, but only test awareness of phishing issues and techniques, not general security awareness. Gamified applications are continuing to grow in popularity, but the ease of use and availability of surveys make them the most popular. Finally, assessment tests may be used when compliance knowledge assessments are required to meet a specific standard, but testing is not as common as surveying. 16 . D. The IP addresses that his clients have provided are RFC 1918 nonroutable IP addresses, and Jim will not be able to scan them from off-site. To succeed in his penetration test, he will have to either first penetrate their network border or place a machine inside their network to scan from the inside. IP addresses overlapping is not a real concern for scanning, and the ranges can easily be handled by current scanning systems. 17 . B. Ethical (or responsible) disclosure practices will provide companies and organizations with a reasonable period of time to fix a flaw and to get that fix into the hands of their customers. Two weeks is unlikely to be a 152/220 reasonable amount of time for this. Unfortunately, Mark may not be able to persuade the individual to make a different decision, and Mark's company will need to determine what to do about the issue. 18 . B. Group Policy enforced by Active Directory can ensure consistent logging settings and can provide regular enforcement of policy on systems. Periodic configuration audits won't catch changes made between audits, and local policies can drift due to local changes or differences in deployments. A Windows syslog client will enable the Windows systems to send syslog to the SIEM appliance but won't ensure consistent logging of events. 19 . B. Windows systems generate logs in the Windows native logging format. To send syslog events, Windows systems require a helper application or tool. Enterprise wireless access points, firewalls, and Linux systems all typically support syslog. 20 . B. Network Time Protocol (NTP) can ensure that systems are using the same time, allowing time sequencing for logs throughout a centralized logging infrastructure. Syslog is a way for systems to send logs to a logging server and won't address time sequencing. Neither logsync nor SNAP is an industry term. 21 . A. When a tester does not have raw packet creation privileges, such as when they have not escalated privileges on a compromised host, a TCP connect scan can be used. TCP SYN scans require elevated privileges on most Linux systems due to the need to write raw packets. A UDP scan will miss most services that are provided via TCP, and an ICMP is merely a ping sweep of systems that respond to pings and won't identify services at all. 22 . B. Joseph may be surprised to discover FTP (TCP port 21) and Telnet (TCP port 23) open on his network since both services are unencrypted and have been largely replaced by SSH, and SCP or SFTP. SSH uses port 22, SMTP uses port 25, and POP3 uses port 110. 23 . D. Large organizations hire QSAs, or qualified security assessors, to conduct compliance checks. Third-party certification is required for large organizations by PCI-DSS, although smaller organizations can self-certify. 24 . A. A test coverage analysis is often used to provide insight into how well testing covered the set of use cases that an application is being tested for. Source code reviews look at the code of a program for bugs, not necessarily at a use case analysis, whereas fuzzing tests invalid inputs. A code review report might be generated as part of a source code review. 25 . C. Testing how a system could be misused, or misuse testing, focuses on behaviors that are not what the organization desires or that are counter to the proper function of a system or application. Use case testing is used to verify whether a desired functionality works. Dynamic testing is used to determine how code handles variables that change over time, whereas manual testing is just what it implies: testing code by hand. 26 . B. Synthetic transaction monitoring uses emulated or recorded transactions to monitor for performance changes in response time, functionality, or other performance monitors. Passive monitoring uses a span port or other method to copy traffic and monitor it in real time. Log analysis is typically performed against actual log data but can be performed on simulated traffic to identify issues. Simulated transaction analysis is not an industry term. 27 . B. Identity and access management (IAM) systems combine life-cycle management and monitoring tools to ensure that identity and authorization are properly handled throughout an organization. Derek should invest in a capable IAM system and ensure that it is configured to use appropriate workflows and to generate the logs and reports that he needs. EDR systems are endpoint detection and response tools and are used to protect against compromise by advanced attackers. 28 . C. Vulnerability scanners that do not have administrative rights to access a machine or that are not using an agent to scan remote machines to gather information, including fingerprints from responses to queries and connections, banner information from services, and related data. CVE information is Common Vulnerability and Exposure information, or vulnerability information. A port scanner gathers information about what service ports are open, although some port scanners blur the line between port and vulnerability scanners. Patch management tools typically run as an agent on a system to allow them to both monitor patch levels and update the system as needed. Service validation typically involves testing the functionality of a service, not its banner and response patterns. 29 . B. Emily is using synthetic transactions, which can use recorded or generated transactions, and is conducting use-case testing to verify that the application responds properly to actual use cases. Neither actual data nor dynamic monitoring is an industry term. Fuzzing involves sending unexpected inputs to a program to see how it responds. Passive monitoring uses a network tap or other capture technology to allow monitoring of actual traffic to a system or application. 30 . B. Real user monitoring (RUM) is a passive monitoring technique that records user interaction with an application or system to ensure performance and proper application behavior. RUM is often used as part of a predeployment process using the actual user interface. The other answers are all made up—synthetic monitoring uses simulated behavior, but synthetic user monitoring is not a testing method. Similarly, passive monitoring monitors actual traffic, but passive user recording is not an industry term or technique. Client-server testing merely describes one possible architecture. 31 . B. Jim should ask the information security team to flag the issue as resolved if he is sure the patch was installed. Many vulnerability scanners rely on version information or banner information and may flag patched versions if the software provider does not update the information they see. Uninstalling and reinstalling the patch will not change this. Changing the version information may not change all of the details that are being flagged by the scanner and may cause issues at a later date. Reviewing the vulnerability information for a workaround may be a good idea but should not be necessary if the proper patch is installed; it can create maintenance issues later. 32 . B. zzuf is the only fuzzer on the list, and zzuf is specifically designed to work with tools like web browsers, image viewers, and similar software by modifying network and file input to applications. Nmap is a port scanner, Nessus is a vulnerability scanner, and Nikto is a web server scanner. 33 . D. Most IaaS vendors will not allow customers to conduct an audit of their systems and infrastructure. Kara is likely to be able to obtain third-party audit reports from her vendor, and the major IaaS vendors typically either make these available publicly or to paying or prospective customers. An internal audit will not assess the underlying infrastructure and services, only those that the organization uses. 34 . A. Passive scanning can help identify rogue devices by capturing MAC address vendor IDs that do not match deployed devices, by verifying that systems match inventories of organizationally owned hardware by hardware address and by monitoring for rogue SSIDs or connections. 153/220 Scripted attacks are part of active scanning rather than passive scanning, and active scanning is useful for testing IDS or IPS systems, whereas passive scanning will not be detected by detection systems. Finally, a shorter dwell time can actually miss troublesome traffic, so balancing dwell time versus coverage is necessary for passive wireless scanning efforts. 35 . B. In most organizations, senior management needs to approve penetration tests because of the risk to the organization and the potential impact of the test. In a small number of organizations, the service owner may be able to make this decision, but penetration tests often have broader impacts than a single service, meaning that senior management is the proper path. Change advisory boards approve changes, not penetration tests, and system administrators may be advised of the test but do not have the authority in most organizations to sign off on a penetration test. 36 . D. Regression testing, which is a type of functional or unit testing, tests to ensure that changes have not introduced new issues. Nonregression testing checks to see whether a change has had the effect it was supposed to, smoke testing focuses on simple problems with impact on critical functionality, and evolution testing is not a software testing technique. 37 . D. Nmap, Nessus, and Nikto all have OS fingerprinting or other operating system identification capabilities. Sqlmap is designed to perform automated detection and testing of SQL injection flaws and does not provide OS detection. 38 . C. Key risk indicators are used to tell those in charge of risk management how risky an activity is and how much impact changes are having on that risk profile. Identifying and monitoring key risk indicators can help track high-risk areas earlier in their life cycle. Yearly risk assessments may be a good idea but provide only a point-intime view, whereas penetration tests may miss out on risks that are not directly security-related. Monitoring logs and events using a SIEM device can help detect issues as they occur but won't necessarily show trends in risk. 39 . C. Passive monitoring works only after issues have occurred because it requires actual traffic. Synthetic monitoring uses simulated or recorded traffic and thus can be used to proactively identify problems. Both synthetic and passive monitoring can be used to detect functionality issues. 40 . B. Getting authorization is the most critical element in the planning phase. Permission, and the “get-out-of-jailfree card” that demonstrates that organizational leadership is aware of the issues that a penetration test could cause, is the first step in any penetration test. Gathering tools and building a lab, as well as determining what type of test will be conducted, are all important, but nothing should happen without permission. 41 . C. Discovery can include both active and passive discovery. Port scanning is commonly done during discovery to assess what services the target provides, and nmap is one of the most popular tools used for this purpose. Nessus and Nikto might be used during the vulnerability scanning phase, and john, a password cracker, can be used to recover passwords during the exploitation phase. 42 . B. Penetration test reports often include information that could result in additional exposure if they were accidentally released or stolen. Therefore, determining how vulnerability data should be stored and sent is critical. Problems with off-limits targets are more likely to result in issues during the vulnerability assessment and exploitation phase, and reports should not be limited in length but should be as long as they need to be to accomplish the goals of the test. 43 . B. Code coverage testing most frequently requires that every function has been called, that each statement has been executed, that all branches have been fully explored, and that each condition has been evaluated for all possibilities. API, input, and loop testing are not common types of code coverage testing measures. 44 . B. Time to remediate a vulnerability is a commonly used key performance indicator for security teams. Time to live measures how long a packet can exist in hops, business criticality is a measure used to determine how important a service or system is to an organization, and coverage rates are used to measure how effective code testing is. 45 . D. Unique user IDs provide accountability when paired with auditable logs to provide that a specific user took any given action. Confidentiality, availability, and integrity can be provided through other means like encryption, systems design, and digital signatures. 46 . B. Application programming interfaces (APIs), user interfaces (UIs), and physical interfaces are all important to test when performing software testing. Network interfaces are not part of the typical list of interfaces tested in software testing. 47 . C. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database provides a consistent reference for identifying security vulnerabilities. The Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) is used to describe the security condition of a system. The Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) is used to create security checklists in a standardized fashion. The Script Check Engine (SCE) is designed to make scripts interoperable with security policy definitions. 48 . B, C. Test 2's total failure is likely due to a failed test run, but the tests overall show continued improvement with full success in test 4. At this point, most testing processes would consider the testing complete. This does not show coverage, and there is no reason to run a fifth run if the fourth test was successful. 49 . C. Simply updating the version that an application provides may stop the vulnerability scanner from flagging it, but it won't fix the underlying issue. Patching, using workarounds, or installing an application layer firewall or IPS can all help to remediate or limit the impact of the vulnerability. 50 . C. Selah's social engineering attack succeeded in persuading a staff member at the help desk to change a password for someone who they not only couldn't see but who they couldn't verify actually needed their password reset. Black box and zero knowledge are both terms describing penetration tests without information about the organization or system, and help-desk spoofing is not an industry term. 51 . D. The menu shown will archive logs when they reach the maximum size allowed (20 MB). These archives will be retained, which could fill the disk. Log data will not be overwritten, and log data should not be lost when the data is archived. The question does not include enough information to determine if needed information may not be logged. 52 . C. Penetration tests typically do not involve blackouts. Application crashes, denial of service due to system, network, or application failures, and even data corruption can all be hazards of penetration tests. 53 . B. NIST SP 800-53A is titled “Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations: Building Effective Assessment Plans” and covers methods for assessing and measuring controls. NIST 800-12 is an introduction to computer security, 800-34 covers contingency planning, and 800-86 is the “Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response.” 154/220 54 . C. Simulations are the most complete test that can be conducted without the risk that a full failover test creates. Michelle should conduct a simulation to validate as much of her organization's plan as possible. Tabletop exercises and plan reviews provide less complete coverage. 55 . C. Hybrid environment audits involve the complexity of both cloud and on-premises audits. That means that the underlying cloud infrastructure may not be auditable, although Lucca's organization's use and configuration of the cloud will be. On-premises audits are not any more challenging to complete than other audits, hybrid audits can be conducted by third parties, and hybrid audits include both on-premises and cloud auditing challenges and requirements as they are not the same as a cloud-only audit. 56 . A. Port 22 is used by the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol for administrative connections. If Kara wants to restrict administrative connections, she should block access on this port. Port 80 is used for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, and 1433 for Microsoft SQL. 57 . C. The audit finding indicates that the backup administrator may not be monitoring backup logs and taking appropriate action based on what they report, thus resulting in potentially unusable backups. Issues with review, logging, or being aware of the success or failure of backups are less important than not having usable backups. 58 . C. ITIL, which originally stood for IT Infrastructure Library, is a set of practices for IT service management and is not typically used for auditing. The Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT), ISO 27001, and the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements number 18 (SSAE-18) are all used for auditing. 59 . B. COBIT, the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies, is commonly used as an audit framework for evaluating the governance and management of enterprise IT in an organization. The DMCA is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, IEC is the International Electrotechnical Commission that defines standards for electrotechnology, and FISA is the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act, not an audit standard. 60 . B. Kelly's team is using regression testing, which is intended to prevent the recurrence of issues. This means measuring the rate of defect recurrence is appropriate for their work. Time to remediate vulnerabilities is associated with activities such as patching, rather than preparing the patch, whereas a weighted risk trend is used to measure risk over time to an organization. Finally, specific coverage may be useful to determine if they are fully testing their effort, but regression testing is more specifically covered by defect recurrence rates. 61 . C. Static program reviews are typically performed by an automated tool. Program understanding, program comprehension, pair programming, software inspections, and software walk-throughs are all human-centric methods for reviewing code. 62 . A. To fully test code, a white-box test is required. Without full visibility of the code, error conditions or other code could be missed, making a gray-box or black-box test an inappropriate solution. Using dynamic testing that runs against live code could also result in some conditions being missed due to sections of code not being exposed to typical usage. 63 . A. A test coverage report measures how many of the test cases have been completed and is used as a way to provide test metrics when using test cases. A penetration test report is provided when a penetration test is conducted—this is not a penetration test. A code coverage report covers how much of the code has been tested, and a line coverage report is a type of code coverage report, both of which cannot be created in a blackbox test since the code is not accessible to testers. 64 . C. The changes from a testing environment with instrumentation inserted into the code and the production environment for the code can mask timing-related issues like race conditions. Bounds checking, input validation, and pointer manipulation are all related to coding issues rather than environmental issues and are more likely to be discoverable in a test environment. 65 . D. Once a vulnerability scanner identifies a potential problem, validation is necessary to verify that the issue exists. Reporting, patching, or other remediation actions can be conducted once the vulnerability has been confirmed. 66 . B. While handling errors and exceptions can be something of an art, the first thing to do in circumstances like these is to review error logs and notifications to try to find out what went wrong. From there, Andrea can make a decision to remediate a problem, send the code back for a fix, or take another action. She might even opt to send the code forward if the error occurred after testing was completed and was with the process flow or another noncritical element, but would do so only if she was absolutely certain that was the case. 67 . D. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) includes metrics and calculation tools for exploitability, impact, how mature exploit code is, and how vulnerabilities can be remediated, as well as a means to score vulnerabilities against users' unique requirements. NVD is the National Vulnerability Database, CSV is short for comma-separated values, and Visual SourceSafe (VSS) is an irrelevant term related to software development rather than vulnerability management. 68 . D. Network-enabled printers often provided services via TCP 515 and 9100 and have both nonsecure and secure web-enabled management interfaces on TCP 80 and 443. Web servers, access points, and file servers would not typically provide service on the LPR and LPD ports (515 and 9100). 69 . A. Nikto, Burp Suite, and Wapiti are all web application vulnerability scanners, tools designed specifically to scan web servers and applications. While they share some functionality with broader vulnerability scanners and port scanning tools, they have a narrower focus and typically have deeper capabilities than vulnerability scanners. 70 . A. APIs typically transfer data for web applications via HTTPS, meaning that the API itself is not responsible for encryption. If Frank's team discovers that TLS is not enabled, they will need to work with the infrastructure or systems administration team to ensure that TLS is enabled and in use rather than making API changes. Authorization for object access, authentication weaknesses, and rate limiting are all common API issues. If you're not familiar with the types of issues you might encounter in APIs, you can read more about them in the OWASP API security top 10 at https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10 . 71 . B. Metasploit is an exploitation package that is designed to assist penetration testers. A tester using Metasploit can exploit known vulnerabilities for which an exploit has been created or can create their own exploits using the tool. While Metasploit provides built-in access to some vulnerability scanning functionality, a tester using Metasploit should primarily be expected to perform actual tests of exploitable vulnerabilities. Similarly, Metasploit supports creating buffer overflow attacks, but it is not a purpose-built buffer overflow testing tool, and of course, testing systems for zero-day exploits doesn't work unless they have been released. 72 . D. Susan is conducting interface testing. Interface testing involves testing system or application components to ensure that they work properly together. Misuse case testing focuses on how an attacker might misuse the 155/220 application and would not test normal cases. Fuzzing attempts to send unexpected input and might be involved in interface testing, but it won't cover the full set of concerns. Regression testing is conducted when testing changes and is used to ensure that the application or system functions as it did before the update or change. 73 . B. Not having enough log sources is not a common consideration in log management system design, although it may be a worry for security managers who can't capture the data they need. Log management system designs must take into account the volume of log data and the network bandwidth it consumes, the security of the data, and the amount of effort required to analyze the data. 74 . D. Random sampling of accounts is the recommended best practice if all accounts cannot be validated. Selecting only recently changed accounts will not identify long-term issues or historic issues, and checking only high-value accounts will not show if there are issues or bad practices with other account types. 75 . C. Rebooting a Windows machine results in an information log entry. Windows defines five types of events: errors, which indicate a significant problem; warnings, which may indicate future problems; information, which describes successful operation; success audits, which record successful security accesses; and failure audits, which record failed security access attempts. 76 . C. Inconsistent timestamps are a common problem, often caused by improperly set time zones or due to differences in how system clocks are set. In this case, a consistent time difference often indicates that one system uses local time, and the other is using Greenwich mean time (GMT). Logs from multiple sources tend to cause problems with centralization and collection, whereas different log formats can create challenges in parsing log data. Finally, modified logs are often a sign of intrusion or malicious intent. 77 . A. Authenticated scans use a read-only account to access configuration files, allowing more accurate testing of vulnerabilities. Web application scans, unauthenticated scans, and port scans don't have access to configuration files unless they are inadvertently exposed. 78 . B. Notifying third parties of security issues and vulnerabilities in a confidential manner to allow them to address the issues is considered ethical disclosure. There is not enough information in the question to determine how it was found, and disclosure is not necessarily part of either penetration tests or application tests. How the information as found is not listed, so OSINT is not a useful answer either. 79 . D. Since a shared symmetric key could be used by any of the servers, transaction identification problems caused by a shared key are likely to involve a repudiation issue. If encrypted transactions cannot be uniquely identified by a server, they cannot be proved to have come from a specific server. 80 . C. Ben should engage a company that can perform a load or stress test to validate how the application performs under both expected and extreme loads so that he knows what a denial-of-service attack based on load will look like. Social engineering does not test the ability of sites to handle load, and penetration testers may conduct denial-of-service attacks but typically do not. Fuzzers send random input to test how applications handle unexpected input rather than relying on extreme load. They might help test for flaws that could result in a denial-of-service condition, but the question specifically asks about load-based conditions, not software flaws. 81 . D. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) allows the synchronization of system clocks with a standardized time source. The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol provides encrypted administrative connections to servers. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used for data exchange. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an encryption process used to protect information in transit over a network. 82 . C. Fuzz testers are capable of automatically generating input sequences to test an application. Therefore, testers do not need to manually generate input, although they may do so if they want. Fuzzers can reproduce errors (and thus, “fuzzers can't reproduce errors” is not an issue) but typically don't fully cover the code—code coverage tools are usually paired with fuzzers to validate how much coverage was possible. Fuzzers are often limited to simple errors because they won't handle business logic or attacks that require knowledge from the application user. 83 . D. Statement coverage tests verify that every line of code was executed during the test. Branch coverage verifies that every if statement was executed under all if and els e conditions. Condition coverage verifies that every logical test in the code was executed under all sets of inputs. Function coverage verifies that every function in the code was called and returns results. 84 . C. After scanning for open ports using a port scanning tool like nmap, penetration testers will identify interesting ports and then conduct vulnerability scans to determine what services may be vulnerable. This will perform many of the same activities that connecting via a web server will and will typically be more useful than trying to manually test for vulnerable accounts via Telnet. Sqlmap would typically be used after a vulnerability scanner identifies additional information about services, and the vulnerability scanner will normally provide a wider range of useful information. 85 . B. The system is likely a Linux system. The system shows X11, as well as login, shell, and nfs ports, all of which are more commonly found on Linux systems than Windows systems or network devices. This system is also very poorly secured; many of the services running on it should not be exposed in a modern secure network. 86 . D. Nmap scans only 1000 TCP and UDP ports by default, including ports outside the 0–1024 range of “wellknown” ports. By using the defaults for nmap, Ben missed 64,535 ports. OS fingerprinting won't cover more ports but would have provided a best guess of the OS running on the scanned system. 87 . A. When Lucca reviews the recovery time objective (RTO) data, he needs to ensure that the organization can recover from an outage in less than two hours based on the maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) of two hours. 88 . C. Diana should request a SOC 3 report, which is intended for distribution to third parties. They include the auditor's opinions and management assertions, along with information about the service organization. SOC 3 reports are specifically intended for external release, unlike SOC 1 (financial reporting) and SOC 2 (confidentiality, security, and privacy) engagements. SOC 4 was made up for the question. 89 . A. Showing end users error information about the code, particularly with directory and file information included, means that the application does not perform proper exception handling. Errors should be logged or noted in a way that the administrator can handle, but end users (and attackers!) should not see that information. The software may be handling misuse properly, as the problem does not note if this was due to normal testing or misuse testing. There is no information about debugging code causing the output, and test coverage was not noted in the question. 90 . B. Port scanning is the first step toward identifying potentially exploitable services. Data gathering is used to acquire information to prepare for port scanning and other activities. Permission and planning are not used to identify exploitable services but are critical to the overall process. 91 . C. Validating that the organization has secure and usable backups is Josh's best answer. In case a system is 156/220 affected by cryptographic malware, it's important to have reliable backups that are not encrypted by the malware. This requires keeping your backup systems separate from your main systems and potentially implementing version control so that your unencrypted backups are not overwritten by encrypted ones that become inaccessible. Encrypting sensitive data won't stop attackers from re-encrypting it, making it inaccessible. Hashing to detect the attack won't stop it or make it possible to recover, and anti-encryption technology does not exist. 92 . D. IT service management, or ITSM, tools include change management and thus the type of approvals and review processes that Joanna is looking for. A SIEM helps with security logs and events, an IPS looks for intrusions and unwanted traffic, and a CMS is a content management tool. 93 . D. All of these are useful parts of a backup strategy, but performing full restores from backups on a regular basis is the best option listed. If regular restores work, then individual files will be recoverable, but individual files may not show larger issues with backups. Configuration and setting reviews are important but will not validate the backups themselves, and error messages can indicate problems but won't demonstrate intact logs either. 94 . C. Vulnerability scanners cannot detect vulnerabilities for which they do not have a test, plug-in, or signature. Signatures often include version numbers, service fingerprints, or configuration data. They can detect local vulnerabilities as well as those that require authentication if they are provided with credentials, and of course, they can detect service vulnerabilities. 95 . A, B. The number of staff who took a given training and the average change in their awareness from before the training to after the training can provide insight into how many trained staff you have and how impactful the training was. Over time, this will allow you to determine if your training is helping and if awareness is increasing. The length of the training does not assess its impact; in addition, the number of events each individual attended does not mean that staff are becoming more aware. 96 . C. Ethical (or responsible) disclosure norms include notifying the vendor and providing them with a reasonable amount of time to remediate the issue. Public disclosures before notifying the vendor or in a short period of time are considered unethical in most circumstances. While this time frame varies, 90 to 120 days is not uncommon across the industry due to the complexity of software and other technologies. 97 . D. Privilege escalation occurs during the attack phase of a penetration test. Host and service information gathering, as well as activities like dumpster diving that can provide information about the organization, its systems, and security, are all part of the discovery phase. 98 . B. Once additional tools have been installed, penetration testers will typically use them to gain additional access. From there they can further escalate privileges, search for new targets or data, and, once again, install more tools to allow them to pivot further into infrastructure or systems. 99 . B. Penetration testing reports often do not include the specific data captured during the assessment, as the readers of the report may not be authorized to access all of the data, and exposure of the report could result in additional problems for the organization. A listing of the issues discovered, risk ratings, and remediation guidance are all common parts of a penetration test report. 100 . The status messages match with the descriptions as follows: 1 . Open: C. The port is accessible on the remote system, and an application is accepting connections on that port. 2 . Closed: B. The port is not accessible on the remote system. 3 . Filtered: A. The port is accessible on the remote system, but no application is accepting connections on that port. Chapter 7: Security Operations (Domain 7) 1 . A. The illustration shows an example of a failover cluster, where DB1 and DB2 are both configured as database servers. At any given time, only one will function as the active database server, while the other remains ready to assume responsibility if the first one fails. While the environment may use UPS, tape backup, and cold sites as disaster recovery and business continuity controls, they are not shown in the diagram. 2 . D. The principle of least privilege should guide Joe in this case. He should apply no access permissions by default and then give each user the necessary permissions to perform their job responsibilities. Read only, editor, and administrator permissions may be necessary for one or more of these users, but those permissions should be assigned based upon business need and not by default. 3 . C. While most organizations would want to log attempts to log in to a workstation, this is not considered a privileged administrative activity and would go through normal logging processes. 4 . B. Duress, or being under threat of violence or other constraints, is a concern for organizations such as banks, jewelry stores, or other organizations where an attacker may attempt to force an employee to perform actions. Organizations that expect that a scenario like this may occur will often use duress code words that let others know that they are performing actions under threat. 5 . D. Real evidence consists of things that may actually be brought into a courtroom as evidence. For example, real evidence includes hard disks, weapons, and items containing fingerprints. Documentary evidence consists of written items that may or may not be in tangible form. Testimonial evidence is verbal testimony given by witnesses with relevant information. The parol evidence rule says that when an agreement is put into written form, the written document is assumed to contain all the terms of the agreement. 6 . C. A whitelist of allowed applications will ensure that Lauren's users can run only the applications that she preapproves. Blacklists would require her to maintain a list of every application that she doesn't want to allow, which is an almost impossible task. Graylisting is not a technology option. Configuration management can be useful for making sure the right applications are on a PC but typically can't directly prevent users from running undesired applications or programs. 7 . B. A pseudo-flaw is a false vulnerability in a system that may distract an attacker. A honeynet is a network of multiple honeypots that creates a more sophisticated environment for intruders to explore, rather than a feature Colin could use on a honeypot. A darknet is a segment of unused network address space that should have no network activity and, therefore, may be easily used to monitor for illicit activity. A warning banner is a legal tool used to notify intruders that they are not authorized to access a system. 8 . B. Social media is commonly used as a command-and-control system for botnet activity. The most likely scenario here is that the user's computer was infected with malware and joined to a botnet. This accounts for 157/220 both the unusual social media traffic and the slow system activity. 9 . A. John's design provides multiple processing sites, distributing load to multiple regions. Not only does this provide business continuity and disaster recovery functionality, but it also means that his design will be more resilient to denial-of-service attacks. 10 . A. NetFlow records contain an entry for every network communication session that took place on a network and can be compared to a list of known malicious hosts. IDS logs may contain a relevant record, but it is less likely because they would create log entries only if the traffic triggers the IDS, as opposed to NetFlow records, which encompass all communications. Authentication logs and RFC logs would not have records of any network traffic. 11 . B. Gary should follow the least privilege principle and assign users only the permissions they need to perform their job responsibilities. Privilege creep is a term used to describe the unintentional accumulation of privileges over time. Segregation of duties and separation of privileges are principles used to secure sensitive processes. 12 . A. The matrix shown in the figure is known as a segregation of duties matrix. It is used to ensure that one person does not obtain two privileges that would create a potential conflict. Privilege creep is a term used to describe the unintentional accumulation of privileges over time. Two-person control is used when two people must work together to perform a sensitive action. Defense in depth is a general security principle used to describe a philosophy of overlapping security controls. 13 . B. Before granting access, Gary should verify that the user has a valid security clearance and a business need to know the information. Gary is performing an authorization task, so he does not need to verify the user's credentials, such as a password or biometric scan. 14 . D. Gary should follow the principle of two-person control by requiring simultaneous action by two separate authorized individuals to gain access to the encryption keys. He should also apply the principles of least privilege and defense in depth, but these principles apply to all operations and are not specific to sensitive operations. Gary should avoid the security through obscurity principle, the reliance upon the secrecy of security mechanisms to provide security for a system or process. 15 . A, B, C. Privileged access reviews are one of the most critical components of an organization's security program because they ensure that only authorized users have access to perform the most sensitive operations. They should take place whenever a user with privileged access leaves the organization or changes roles as well as on a regular, recurring basis. However, it is not reasonable to expect that these time-consuming reviews would take place on a daily basis. 16 . D. Hotfixes, updates, and security fixes are all synonyms for single patches designed to correct a single problem. Service packs are collections of many different updates that serve as a major update to an operating system or application. 17 . C. A forensic disk controller performs four functions. One of those, write blocking, intercepts write commands sent to the device and prevents them from modifying data on the device. The other three functions include returning data requested by a read operation, returning access-significant information from the device, and reporting errors from the device back to the forensic host. 18 . A. Lydia is following the need to know principle. While the user may have the appropriate security clearance to access this information, there is no business justification provided, so she does not know that the user has an appropriate need to know the information. 19 . C. Job rotation and mandatory vacations deter fraud by increasing the likelihood that it will be detected. Twoperson control deters fraud by requiring collusion between two employees. Incident response does not normally serve as a deterrent mechanism. 20 . B. Quality of service is a feature found on routers and other network devices that can prioritize specific network traffic. QoS policies define which traffic is prioritized, and traffic is then handled based on the policy. 21 . A. The change log contains information about approved changes and the change management process. While other logs may contain details about the change's effect, the audit trail for change management would be found in the change log. 22 . B. While it may be tempting to tell her staff to simply not connect to any network, Susan knows that they will need connectivity to do their work. Using a VPN to connect their laptops and mobile devices to a trusted network and ensuring that all traffic is tunneled through the VPN is her best bet to secure their Internet usage. Susan may also want to ensure that they take “clean” laptops and devices that do not contain sensitive information or documents and that those systems are fully wiped when they return. 23 . D. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database contains standardized information on many different security issues. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) contains general guidance on web application security issues but does not track specific vulnerabilities or go beyond web applications. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) maintains benchmarks for securely configuring devices, operating systems, and applications. They do not track vulnerabilities. Microsoft Security Bulletins are also good sources of vulnerability information but are not comprehensive databases of known issues. 24 . A, B, C, D. A disaster is any event that can disrupt normal IT operations and can be either natural or human made. Hacking and terrorism are examples of human-made disasters, while flooding and fire are examples of natural disasters. 25 . D. The read-through is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a read-through, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and discuss a specific scenario without making any changes to information systems. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. 26 . B. The Grandfather-Father-Son, Tower of Hanoi, and Six Cartridge Weekly schemes are all different approaches to rotating backup media that balance reuse of media with data retention concerns. Meet-in-themiddle is a cryptographic attack against 2DES encryption. 27 . B. In this scenario, Helen designed a process that requires the concurrence of two people to perform a sensitive action. This is an example of two-person control. This is different from segregation of duties, where one individual may not have two separate permissions that, when combined, might allow an unwanted action. Segregation of duties applied to a situation like this one might say that the same person may not have both the ability to initiate a request and the ability to approve a request. Least privilege says that an individual should 158/220 have only the necessary permissions required to carry out their job function. Job rotation is a scheme that has users periodically shift job functions in order to detect malfeasance. 28 . C. Evidence provided in court must be relevant to determining a fact in question, material to the case at hand, and competently obtained. Evidence does not need to be tangible. Witness testimony is an example of intangible evidence that may be offered in court. 29 . A. A lessons learned document is often created and distributed to involved parties after a postmortem review to ensure that those who were involved in the incident and others who may benefit from the knowledge are aware of what they can do to prevent future issues and to improve response in the event that one occurs. 30 . A, C, D. CSIRT representation normally includes at least representatives of senior management, information security professionals, legal representatives, public relations staff, human resources, and engineering/technical staff. Law enforcement personnel would not be included on such a team and would only be consulted as necessary. 31 . C. In this scenario, all the files on the server will be backed up on Monday evening during the full backup. The differential backup on Wednesday will then copy all files modified since the last full backup. These include files 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6: a total of five files. 32 . C. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) provide only passive responses, such as alerting administrators to a suspected attack. Intrusion prevention systems and firewalls, on the other hand, may take action to block an attack attempt. Antivirus software also may engage in active response by quarantining suspect files. 33 . C. Physical destruction, an appropriate contract with certification, and secure wiping are all reasonable options. In each case, a careful inventory and check should be done to ensure that each drive is handled appropriately. Reformatting drives can leave remnant data, making this a poor data life-cycle choice for drives that contain sensitive data. 34 . D. Secure router configuration guidelines are typically more technical and specific to IT professionals, making them less likely to be included in a general security training and awareness program. These programs usually focus on broader and more universally applicable topics like insider threats, which address risks from employees or contractors; social media impact, which covers the risks of sharing information online; and 2FA fatigue, which relates to the weariness or complacency in using two-factor authentication. These are relevant to a wider audience and are crucial for overall organizational security awareness. In contrast, the specifics of router configuration are usually handled by specialized IT staff. 35 . A. The service-level agreement (SLA) is between a service provider and a customer and documents in a formal manner expectations around availability, performance, and other parameters. An MOU may cover the same items but is not as formal a document. An OLA is between internal service organizations and does not involve customers. An SOW is an addendum to a contract describing work to be performed. 36 . A. The ITIL framework focuses on IT service management. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) provides a common core of project management expertise. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) contains regulations for payment card security. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) focuses on IT architecture issues. 37 . D. Latency is a delay in the delivery of packets from their source to their destination. Jitter is a variation in the latency for different packets. Packet loss is the disappearance of packets in transit that requires retransmission. Interference is electrical noise or other disruptions that corrupt the contents of packets. 38 . B. Running the program in a sandbox provides secure isolation that can prevent the malware from impacting other applications or systems. If Joe uses appropriate instrumentation, he can observe what the program does, what changes it makes, and any communications it may attempt. ASLR is a memory location randomization technology. Process isolation keeps processes from impacting each other. A sandbox typically provides greater 159/220 utility in a scenario like this since it can be instrumented and managed in a way that better supports investigations. Clipping is a term often used in signal processing. 39 . D. A transformer explosion is a failure of a human-made electrical component. Flooding, mudslides, and hurricanes are all examples of natural disasters. 40 . A. Microsoft Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) provides this capability and is designed to allow administrators to evaluate the configuration status of Windows workstations and servers, as well as providing asset management data. System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) is primarily used to monitor for health and performance. Group Policy can be used for a variety of tasks including deploying settings and software, and custom PowerShell scripts could do this but should not be required for a configuration check. 41 . B. The principle of least privilege says that an individual should only have the privileges necessary to complete their job functions. Removing administrative privileges from nonadministrative users is an example of least privilege. 42 . D. There is no need to conduct forensic imaging as a preventative measure. Rather, forensic imaging should be used during the incident response process. Maintaining patch levels, implementing intrusion detection/prevention, and removing unnecessary services and accounts are all basic preventive measures. 43 . B. A resource capacity agreement is the most appropriate for Chas's concern, as it specifically addresses the availability of resources in a disaster scenario. This type of agreement ensures that the cloud provider has sufficient resources to meet the needs of their clients, even in the event of multiple simultaneous disasters. It directly tackles the issue of resource allocation and availability, which is Chas's primary concern. In contrast, a nondisclosure agreement is more about confidentiality and doesn't address resource capacity. A mutual assistance agreement typically involves agreements between organizations for support during emergencies but doesn't guarantee specific resource availability. A business partnership agreement is broader and may not specifically cover the detailed aspects of resource availability in disaster scenarios. 44 . C. An incident negatively affects the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or assets and/or violates a security policy. A computer security incident is an incident that is the result of an attack or the result of malicious or intentional actions on the part of users. The unauthorized vulnerability scan of a server does violate security policy and may negatively affect the security of that system, so it qualifies as a security incident. The failure of a backup to complete properly jeopardizes availability and is, therefore, an incident, but not a computer security incident. The logging of system access and update of antivirus signatures are all routine actions that do not violate policy or jeopardize security, so they are all events rather than incidents. 45 . C. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is a cost-effective way to track items around a facility. While Wi-Fi could be used for the same purpose, it would be much more expensive to implement. 46 . C. An attack committed against an organization by an insider, such as an employee, is known as sabotage. Espionage and confidentiality breaches involve the theft of sensitive information, which is not alleged to have occurred in this case. Integrity breaches involve the unauthorized modification of information, which is not described in this scenario. 47 . A. In a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN packets to a system but does not respond to the SYN/ACK packets, attempting to overwhelm the attacked system's connection state table with half-open connections. 48 . B. The maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) is the longest amount of time that an IT service or component may be unavailable without causing serious damage to the organization. The recovery time objective (RTO) is the amount of time expected to return an IT service or component to operation after a failure. The recovery point objective (RPO) identifies the maximum amount of data, measured in time, that may be lost during a recovery effort. Service-level agreements (SLAs) are written contracts that document service expectations. 49 . C. Zero-day attacks are those that are previously unknown to the security community and, therefore, have no available patch. These are especially dangerous attacks because they may be highly effective until a solution becomes available. The other attacks described here are all known attacks and would not be classified as zeroday events. 50 . D. Locard's principle is most relevant to Rob's forensic investigation for trace digital evidence, as it suggests that any contact between two objects results in an exchange of materials. In the context of digital forensics, this principle implies that there is always some form of digital trace or residue left behind when devices interact or when data is transferred. Kerckhoff's principle states that a system's security should not depend on the secrecy of its algorithm but rather on the secrecy of its keys. The principle of least privilege is a security concept in which a user is given the minimum levels of access—or permissions—needed to perform his job functions. Lastly, the defense-in-depth principle is a layered security approach that establishes multiple levels of defense to protect information. While these other three principles are important in cybersecurity, they do not directly relate to the collection and analysis of digital trace evidence like Locard's principle does. 51 . A. Interviews occur when investigators meet with an individual who may have information relevant to their investigation but is not a suspect. If the individual is a suspect, then the meeting is an interrogation. 52 . D. The image clearly contains the watermark of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), which ensures that anyone seeing the image knows its origin. It is not possible to tell from looking at the image whether steganography was used. Sampling and clipping are data analysis techniques and are not used to protect images. 53 . D. The annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) is the expected number of times an incident will occur each year. In the case of a 200-year flood plain, planners should expect a flood once every 200 years. This is equivalent to a 1/200 chance of a flood in any given year, or 0.005 floods per year. 54 . B. While all hackers with malicious intent pose a risk to the organization, the malicious insider poses the greatest risk to security because they likely have legitimate access to sensitive systems that may be used as a launching point for an attack. Other attackers do not begin with this advantage. 55 . C. In an electronic vaulting approach, automated technology moves database backups from the primary database server to a remote site on a scheduled basis, typically daily. Transaction logging is not a recovery technique alone; it is a process for generating the logs used in remote journaling. Remote journaling transfers transaction logs to a remote site on a more frequent basis than electronic vaulting, typically hourly. Remote mirroring maintains a live database server at the backup site and mirrors all transactions at the primary site on 160/220 the server at the backup site. 56 . B. Hilda's design follows the principle of segregation of duties. Giving one user the ability to both create new accounts and grant administrative privileges combines two actions that would result in a significant security change that should be divided among two users. 57 . C. While all of these assumptions are valid premises that Patrick might have going into the exercise, the basic assumption of a threat-hunting exercise is the so-called presumption of compromise. This means that Patrick should assume that attackers have already gained access to his system and then hunt for indicators of their presence. 58 . C. The end goal of the disaster recovery process is restoring normal business operations in the primary facility. All of the other actions listed may take place during the disaster recovery process, but the process is not complete until the organization is once again functioning normally in its primary facilities. 59 . C. A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) may be able to detect unauthorized processes running on a system. The other controls mentioned, network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), firewalls, and DLP systems, are network-based and may not notice rogue processes. 60 . B. The scenario describes a privilege escalation attack where a malicious insider with authorized access to a system misused that access to gain privileged credentials. 61 . B. Carla's account has experienced privilege creep, where privileges accumulated over time. This condition is also known as aggregation and likely constitutes a violation of the least privilege principle. 62 . C. The mitigation phase of incident response focuses on actions that can contain the damage incurred during an incident. This includes limiting the scope and/or effectiveness of the incident. The detection phase identifies that an incident is taking place. The response phase includes steps taken to assemble a team and triage the incident. At the conclusion of the recovery phase, normal operations are resumed. 63 . C. At this point in the process, Ann has no reason to believe that any actual security compromise or policy violation took place, so this situation does not meet the criteria for a security incident or intrusion. Rather, the alert generated by the intrusion detection system is simply a security event requiring further investigation. Security occurrence is not a term commonly used in incident handling. 64 . A. DNS traffic commonly uses port 53 for both TCP and UDP communications. SSH and SCP use TCP port 22. SSL and TLS do not have ports assigned to them but are commonly used for HTTPS traffic on port 443. Unencrypted web traffic over HTTP often uses port 80. 65 . D. The attack described in this scenario has all the hallmarks of a denial-of-service attack. More specifically, Ann's organization is likely experiencing a DNS amplification attack where an attacker sends false requests to third-party DNS servers with a forged source IP address belonging to the targeted system. Because the attack uses UDP requests, there is no three-way handshake. The attack packets are carefully crafted to elicit a lengthy response from a short query. The purpose of these queries is to generate responses headed to the target system that are sufficiently large and numerous enough to overwhelm the targeted network or system. 66 . B. Now that Ann suspects an attack against her organization, she has sufficient evidence to declare a security incident. The attack underway seems to have undermined the availability of her network, meeting one of the criteria for a security incident. This is an escalation beyond a security event but does not reach the level of an intrusion because there is no evidence that the attacker has even attempted to gain access to systems on Ann's network. Security occurrence is not a term commonly used in incident handling. 67 . D. To be admissible, evidence must be relevant, material, and competent. The laptop in this case is clearly material because it contains logs related to the crime in question. It is also relevant because it provides evidence that ties the hacker to the crime. It is not competent because the evidence was not legally obtained. 68 . C. Gordon may conduct his investigation as he wants and use any information that is legally available to him, including information and systems belonging to his employer. There is no obligation to contact law enforcement. However, Gordon may not perform “hack back” activities because those may constitute violations of the law and/or ISC2 Code of Ethics. 69 . B. Software escrow agreements place a copy of the source code for a software package in the hands of an independent third party who will turn the code over to the customer if the vendor ceases business operations. Service-level agreements, mutual assistance agreements, and compliance agreements all lose some or all of their effectiveness if the vendor goes out of business. 70 . C. Most security professionals recommend at least one, and preferably two, weeks of vacation to deter fraud. The idea is that fraudulent schemes will be uncovered during the time that the employee is away and does not have the access required to perpetuate a cover-up. 71 . A, B, C, E, F. Any attempt to undermine the security of an organization or violation of a security policy is a security incident. All of the events described meet this definition and should be treated as an incident, with one exception. A successful attempt to access a file is certainly a security event, but it is not a security incident unless it is established that the individual accessing the file was not authorized to do so. 72 . A, B, C. Egress filtering scans outbound traffic for potential security policy violations. This includes traffic that is likely malicious, such as an outbound SSH scan on port 22. It also includes traffic that appears to be part of an attack or misconfiguration, such as sending traffic to a broadcast destination address. Finally, it includes spoofed traffic generated by internal systems, which may bear a source address from an external network. The normal traffic that the firewall should expect to see is that bearing a destination address on an external network. 73 . C. The two main methods of choosing records from a large pool for further analysis are sampling and clipping. Sampling uses statistical techniques to choose a sample that is representative of the entire pool, while clipping uses threshold values to select those records that exceed a predefined threshold because they may be of most interest to analysts. In this case, Allie is only selecting records that exceed an invalid login threshold, making this an example of clipping. She is not using statistical techniques to select a subset of records, so this is not an example of sampling. 74 . B. NetFlow data contains information on the source, destination, and size of all network communications and is routinely saved as a matter of normal activity. Packet capture data would provide relevant information, but it must be captured during the suspicious activity and cannot be re-created after the fact unless the organization is already conducting 100% packet capture, which is rare. Additionally, the use of encryption limits the effectiveness of packet capture. Intrusion detection system logs would not likely contain relevant information because the encrypted traffic would probably not match intrusion signatures. Centralized authentication records 161/220 would not contain information about network traffic. 75 . C. Baseline configurations serve as the starting point for configuring secure systems and applications. They contain the security settings necessary to comply with an organization's security policy and may then be customized to meet the specific needs of an implementation. While security policies and guidelines may contain information needed to secure a system, they do not contain a set of configuration settings that may be applied to a system. The running configuration of a system is the set of currently applied settings, which may or may not be secure. 76 . B. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. The read-through is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a read-through, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and work through a specific scenario without making any changes to information systems. 77 . C. Both the receipt of alerts and the verification of their accuracy occur during the Detection phase of the incident response process. 78 . C. According to NIST SP 800-137, organizations should use the following factors to determine assessment and monitoring frequency: security control volatility, system categorizations/impact levels, security controls or specific assessment objects providing critical functions, security controls with identified weaknesses, organizational risk tolerance, threat information, vulnerability information, risk assessment results, the output of monitoring strategy reviews, and reporting requirements. 79 . D. All of these technologies have the potential to monitor user behavior on endpoint devices. The key to answering this question correctly is realizing the emphasis on the user. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDSs/IPSs) focus on network and host behavior. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems focus on endpoint devices. User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) solutions focus on the user and, therefore, would be the best way to meet Hunter's requirement. 80 . C. SSH uses TCP port 22, so this attack is likely an attempt to scan for open or weakly secured SSH servers. FTP uses ports 20 and 21. Telnet uses port 23, and HTTP uses port 80. 81 . B. Remediation activities seek to address the issue that caused the incident. In this case, that was a web application that was open to SQL injection attack. Adding input validation seeks to remediate this vulnerability. Rebuilding the database is a recovery action, while reviewing logs is done as part of the detection and response effort. 82 . C. In an infrastructure-as-a-service environment, the vendor is responsible for hardware- and network-related responsibilities. These include configuring network firewalls, maintaining the hypervisor, and managing physical equipment. The customer retains responsibility for patching operating systems on its virtual machine instances. 83 . B. Sandboxing is a technique where application developers (or the recipients of an untrusted application) may test the code in a virtualized environment that is isolated from production systems. White-box testing, black-box testing, and penetration testing are all common software testing techniques but do not require the use of an isolated system. 84 . C. While it may not immediately seem like the obvious answer, many firewalls have a built-in anti–SYN flood defense that responds to SYNs on behalf of protected systems. Once the remote system proves to be a legitimate connection by continuing the three-way handshake, the rest of the TCP session is passed through. If the connection proves to be an attack, the firewall handles the additional load using appropriate mitigation techniques. Blocking SYNs from known or unknown IP addresses is likely to cause issues with systems that should be able to connect, and turning off TCP will break most modern network services! 85 . A, B, D. EDR platforms do not conduct simulated phishing campaigns. The most common features of EDR systems are analyzing endpoint memory, filesystem, and network activity for signs of malicious activity; isolating possible malicious activity to contain the potential damage; integrating with threat intelligence sources; and integrating with other incident response mechanisms. 86 . A. While any cybersecurity activity has the potential to benefit from machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, this technology really shines when used for pattern detection and anomaly detection problems. This is the type of activity performed by an intrusion detection system, and, therefore, this system would benefit the most from the use of ML/AI technology. 87 . A. Companies have an obligation to preserve evidence whenever they believe that the threat of litigation is imminent. The statement made by this customer that “we will have to take this matter to court” is a clear threat of litigation and should trigger the preservation of any related documents and records. 88 . A. Incremental backups provide the option that includes the smallest amount of data. In this case, that would be only the data modified since the most recent incremental backup. A differential backup would back up all data modified since the last full backup, which would be a substantial amount. The full backup would include all information on the server. Transaction log backups are specifically designed to support database servers and would not be effective on a file server. 89 . A. Expert opinion evidence allows individuals to offer their opinion based upon the facts in evidence and their personal knowledge. Expert opinion evidence may be offered only if the court accepts the witness as an expert in a particular field. Direct evidence is when witnesses testify about their direct observations. Real evidence consists of tangible items brought into court as evidence. Documentary evidence consists of written records used as evidence in court. 90 . D. The standard methods for clearing magnetic tapes, according to the NIST Guidelines for Media Sanitization, are overwriting the tape with nonsensitive data, degaussing, and physical destruction via shredding. Reformatting a tape does not remove remnant data. 91 . B. RAID level 1, also known as disk mirroring, uses a minimum of two disks that contain identical information. If one disk fails, the other contains the data needed for the system to continue operation. 92 . B. The analysis of application logs is one of the core tasks of software analysis. This is the correct answer because SQL injection attacks are application attacks. 93 . C. Quigley may choose to use any or all of these security controls, but data encryption is, by far, the most important control. It protects the confidentiality of data stored on the tapes, which are most vulnerable to theft while in transit between two secure locations. 94 . C. Data loss prevention (DLP) systems may identify sensitive information stored on endpoint systems or in 162/220 transit over a network. This is their primary purpose. DLP systems are commonly available as a third-party managed service offering. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDSs/IPSs) may be used to identify some sensitive information using signatures built for that purpose, but this is not the primary role of those tools, and they would not be as effective as DLP systems at this task. TLS is a network encryption protocol that may be used to protect sensitive information, but it does not have any ability to identify sensitive information. 95 . C. Disaster recovery teams should always refer media inquiries to the public relations team to ensure a coordinated, consistent response. They should not attempt to answer questions themselves. 96 . D. All of these considerations are important when developing an emergency management plan. However, the safety of human life should always be the overwhelming priority, above all other considerations. 97 . D. Barry should recruit an independent moderator to facilitate the session. Having a moderator who was not directly involved in the effort encourages honest and open feedback. While it is not necessary to use an external consultant, they may easily fill this role. While it is also possible to find a qualified internal employee to fill this position, it should not be someone who was involved in the incident response effort or has a major stake in the plan, such as Barry, the CISO, or the DR team leader. 98 . C. Generators are capable of providing backup power for a sustained period of time in the event of a power loss, but they take time to activate. Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) provide immediate, battery-driven power for a short period of time to cover momentary losses of power, which would not cover a sustained period of power loss. RAID and redundant servers are high-availability controls but do not cover power loss scenarios. 99 . The terms match with the definitions as follows: 1 . Honeypot: C. A system set up with intentional vulnerabilities 2 . Honeynet: B. A network set up with intentional vulnerabilities 3 . Pseudo-flaw: A. An intentionally designed vulnerability used to lure in an attacker 4 . Darknet: D. A monitored network without any hosts 100 . The terms match with the definitions as follows: 1 . Hot site: B. A site with dedicated storage and real-time data replication, often with shared equipment that allows restoration of service in a very short time 2 . Cold site: D. A rented space with power, cooling, and connectivity that can accept equipment as part of a recovery effort 3 . Warm site: C. A site that relies on shared storage and backups for recovery 4 . Service bureau: A. An organization that can provide on-site or off-site IT services in the event of a disaster Chapter 8: Software Development Security (Domain 8) 1 . A. Limiting request rates can prevent abuse of APIs like this one. The other suggestions are all poor recommendations. In general, requests should require HTTPS, tokens are used for security using tools like JSON web tokens (JWT), and HTTP methods may be restricted, but GET, POST, and PUT are some of the most common methods used for API access and are far more typically whitelisted. 2 . A, B, C. Botnets are used for a wide variety of malicious purposes, including scanning the network for vulnerable systems, conducting brute-force attacks against other systems, mining cryptocurrency, and sending out spam messages. They are not commonly used to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, which are normally waged through DNS poisoning or similar mechanisms. 3 . C. Code review takes place after code has been developed, which occurs after the design phase of the system's development life cycle (SDLC). Code review may use a combination of manual and automated techniques or rely solely on one or the other. It should be a peer-driven process that includes developers who did not write the code. Developers should expect to complete the review of around 300 lines per hour, on average. 4 . A. This code is an example of parameterization, which can help avoid SQL injection. Note that each parameter has a placeholder, which is then passed to the query. 5 . C. One of the responsibilities of the release control process is ensuring that acceptance testing is performed, to ensure that any alterations to end-user tasks are understood and functional prior to code release. The request control, change control, and configuration control processes do not include acceptance testing. 6 . B. Cross-site request forgery (XSRF or CSRF) attacks exploit the trust that sites have in a user's browser by attempting to force the submission of authenticated requests to third-party sites. Session hijacking attacks attempt to steal previously authenticated sessions but do not force the browser to submit requests. A SQL injection directly attacks a database through a web application. Cross-site scripting uses reflected input to trick a user's browser into executing untrusted code from a trusted site. 7 . A. The OpenSSL package is a widely used implementation of TLS encryption that is available as an opensource package. It is not commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS). While it might be developed by third parties, it is more accurate to describe it as open source. The library is available as code for free use, but not as a managed service. 8 . D. The error message shown in the figure is the infamous “Blue Screen of Death” that occurs when a Windows system experiences a dangerous failure and enters a fail secure state. If the system had “failed open,” it would have continued operation. The error described is a memory fault that is likely recoverable by rebooting the system. There is no indication that the system has run out of usable memory. 9 . A, B, C. Software threat modeling is designed to reduce the number of security-related design and coding flaws as well as the severity of other flaws. The developer or evaluator of software has no control over the threat environment, because it is external to the organization. 10 . C. In the diagram, Account is the name of the class. Owner and Balance are attributes of that class. AddFunds and RemoveFunds are methods of the class. 11 . D. Rapid Application Development, or RAD, focuses on fast development and the ability to quickly adjust to changing requirements. RAD uses four phases: requirements planning, user design, construction, and cutover. 12 . A. Dynamic testing of software typically occurs in a black-box environment where the tester does not have access to the source code. Static testing, white-box testing, and code review approaches all require access to the source code of the application. 13 . C. Given the list of options here, the root cause is most likely an issue with an authorization check that does not properly limit users to the authorization that they should have. Data validation issues are more likely to allow 163/220 injection attacks or to allow bad data to be input, while session management issues would allow session hijacking or might actually cause them to be logged in as another user. Finally, error handling would show up as a problem when errors occurred, which this problem does not indicate. 14 . C. Aggregate functions summarize large amounts of data and provide only summary information as a result. When carefully crafted, aggregate functions may unintentionally reveal sensitive information. 15 . B. The best protection against buffer overflow attacks is server-side input validation. This technique limits user input to approved ranges of values that fit within allocated buffers. While firewalls and intrusion prevention systems may contain controls that limit buffer overflows, it would be more effective to perform filtering on the application server. Encryption cannot protect against buffer overflow attacks. 16 . C. Each of these problems is caused by improper or missing input validation and can be resolved by handling inputs properly. In many cases, this can be done using libraries or methods already built into the language or framework that the developer is using. 17 . C. Acme Widgets is clearly in the initial stage of the SW-CMM. This stage is characterized by the absence of formal process. The company may still produce working code, but it does so in a disorganized fashion. 18 . B. The Repeatable stage is the second stage in the SW-CMM, following the Initial stage. It should be the next milestone goal for Acme Widgets. The Repeatable stage is characterized by basic life cycle management processes. 19 . A. The Defined stage of the SW-CMM is marked by the presence of basic life cycle management processes and reuse of code. It includes the use of requirements management, software project planning, quality assurance, and configuration management practices. 20 . D. The Managed stage is the fourth stage in the SW-CMM, following the Defined stage. It should be the next milestone goal for Beta Particles. The Managed stage is characterized by the use of quantitative software development measures. 21 . C. Referential integrity ensures that records exist in a secondary table when they are referenced with a foreign key from another table. Foreign keys are the mechanism used to enforce referential integrity. 22 . A. Macro viruses are most commonly found in office productivity documents, such as Microsoft Word documents that end in the .doc or .docx extension. They are not commonly found in executable files with the .com or .exe extension. 23 . C. The degree of a database table is the number of attributes in the table. Victor's table has six attributes: the employee's user ID, home telephone, office telephone, mobile telephone, office location, and job title. 24 . C. The string shown in the logs is characteristic of a directory traversal attack where the attacker attempts to force the web application to navigate up the file hierarchy and retrieve a file that should not normally be provided to a web user, such as the password file. The series of “double dots” is indicative of a directory traversal attack because it is the character string used to reference the directory one level up in a hierarchy. 25 . C. Design reviews should take place after the development of functional and control specifications but before the creation of code. The code review, unit testing, and functional testing all take place after the creation of code and, therefore, after the design review. 26 . C. Regression testing is software testing that runs a set of known inputs against an application and then compares the results to those produced by an earlier version of the software. It is designed to capture unanticipated consequences of deploying new code versions prior to introducing them into a production environment. 27 . D. Assurance, when it comes to software, is the level of confidence that software is free from vulnerabilities, either intentionally designed into the software or accidentally inserted at any time during its life cycle, and that the software functions in the intended manner. It is a term typically used in military and defense environments. 28 . C. The change control process is responsible for providing an organized framework within which multiple developers can create and test a solution prior to rolling it out in a production environment. Request control provides a framework for user requests. Release control manages the deployment of code into production. Configuration control ensures that changes to software versions are made in accordance with the change and configuration management policies. 29 . D. Aggregation is a security issue that arises when a collection of facts has a higher classification than the classification of any of those facts standing alone. An inference problem occurs when an attacker can pull together pieces of less sensitive information and use them to derive information of greater sensitivity. SQL injection is a web application exploit. Multilevel security is a system control that allows the simultaneous processing of information at different classification levels. 30 . B. Code libraries are packages of reusable functions that may be incorporated into individual development projects. Ron could use libraries to easily share code among his team. Code repositories may be used to manage the distribution and updating of these libraries, but that is a second-order use case, making code libraries the best answer. Integrated development environments (IDEs) are tools used by developers to create software, while dynamic application security testing (DAST) is used to verify the correct implementation of code. 31 . A. Black-box testing begins with no prior knowledge of the system implementation, simulating a user's perspective. White-box and gray-box testing provide full and partial knowledge of the system, respectively, in advance of the test. Blue boxes are a phone hacking tool and are not used in software testing. 32 . B. In this example, the two SQL commands are indeed bundled in a transaction, but it is not an error to issue an update command that does not match any rows. Therefore, the first command would “succeed” in updating zero rows and not generate an error or cause the transaction to roll back. The second command would then execute, reducing the balance of the second account by $250. 33 . A. Software development kits (SDKs) are code libraries and other tools made available to assist developers in creating code. An integrated development environment (IDE) may be a component of an SDK, but it is not necessarily part of every SDK. An application programming interface (API) is a set of functions made available to external developers, but the code does not execute on the users' machine, as would a code library or other SDK tools. Data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities are not a component of software development toolsets. 34 . C. A fail open configuration may be appropriate in this case. In this configuration, the firewall would continue to pass traffic without inspection while it is restarting. This would minimize downtime, and the traffic would still be protected by the other security controls described in the scenario. Failover devices and high availability clusters would indeed increase availability, but at potentially significant expense. Redundant disks would not help in this scenario because no disk failure is described. 35 . D. An inference problem occurs when an attacker can pull together pieces of less sensitive information and use 164/220 them to derive information of greater sensitivity. SQL injection is a web application exploit. Multilevel security is a system control that allows the simultaneous processing of information at different classification levels. Parameterization is a security control used to reduce the likelihood of attacks that rely upon improper user input. 36 . B. Polymorphic viruses mutate each time they infect a system by making adjustments to their code that assists them in evading signature detection mechanisms. Encrypted viruses also mutate from infection to infection but do so by encrypting themselves with different keys on each device. 37 . A. The message forum is clearly susceptible to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The code that Linda discovered in the message is a definitive example of an attempt to conduct cross-site scripting, and the alert box that she received demonstrates that the vulnerability exists. The website may also be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, SQL injection, improper authentication, and other attacks, but there is no evidence of this provided in the scenario. 38 . A. The script that Linda discovered merely pops up a message on a user's screen and does not perform any more malicious action. This type of script, using an alert() call, is commonly used to probe websites for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. 39 . B. Web application firewalls (WAFs) sit in front of web applications and watch for potentially malicious web attacks, including cross-site scripting. They then block that traffic from reaching the web application. An intrusion detection system (IDS) may detect the attack but is unable to take action to prevent it. DLP and VPN solutions are unable to detect web application attacks. 40 . C. Input validation verifies that user-supplied input does not violate security conditions and is the most effective defense against cross-site scripting attacks. Bounds checking is a form of input validation, but it is typically used to ensure that numeric input falls within an acceptable range and is not applicable against cross-site scripting attacks. Peer review and OS patching are both good security practices but are unlikely to be effective against a cross-site scripting attack. 41 . B. RStudio is a tool used to assist in the creation of code, otherwise known as an integrated development environment (IDE). Software development kits (SDKs) are code libraries and other tools made available to assist developers in creating code. An application programming interface (API) is a set of functions made available to external developers, but the code does not execute on the users' machine, as would a code library or other SDK tools. Data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities are not a component of software development toolsets. 42 . D. Full SAFe is designed to support enterprises in building and maintaining large integrated solutions with the collaboration of hundreds of practitioners. It provides the most extensive level of guidance, with roles, responsibilities, and activities needed to sustainably deliver complex solutions. Essential SAFe focuses on the basic elements of the framework needed to be agile, Large Solution SAFe is for developing large and complex solutions that do not require the constructs of the portfolio level, and Portfolio SAFe is for aligning enterprise strategy with execution but does not address the complexity of building large solutions that Full SAFe is designed for. 43 . C. The JVM is the runtime virtual machine that allows the execution of Java code on a device. The JVM implements the Java sandbox, but that is only one of its many functions. The JVM itself is not a change manager or code repository. 44 . C. User acceptance testing (UAT) is typically the last phase of the testing process. It verifies that the solution developed meets user requirements and validates it against use cases. Unit testing, integration testing, and system testing are all conducted earlier in the process leading up to UAT. 45 . D. When organizations adopt a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) approach to software development, they may deploy code extremely rapidly. In fact, some organizations deploy new code to production hundreds or even thousands of times per day using this approach. 46 . C. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is widely considered as the most authoritative source on web application security issues. They publish the OWASP Top Ten list that publicizes the most critical web application security issues. 47 . B. Chris is in an Agile sprint phase and is likely developing code based on user stories. Planning includes stakeholder stories, as well as design and test case preparation. Testing involves ensuring that the code works properly and meets requirements. Deployment includes the actual deployment of the application, as well as additional verification and testing. 48 . D. Security information and event management (SIEM) systems do correlate information from multiple sources and perform analysis, but they stop short of providing automated playbook responses. That is the realm of security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platforms. Intrusion prevention platforms have a more limited scope, allowing the blocking of traffic based upon analysis performed by the IPS itself. Log repositories simply collect log information and do not perform analysis. 49 . B. This is an example of a specific type of buffer overflow known as an off-by-one error. The first line of the code defines an array of 10 elements, which would be numbered 0 through 9. The second line of code tries to place a value in the 11th element of the array (remember, array counting begins at 0!), which would cause an overflow. 50 . C. Lost updates occur when one transaction writes a value to the database that overwrites a value needed by transactions that have earlier precedence, causing those transactions to read an incorrect value. Dirty reads occur when one transaction reads a value from a database that was written by another transaction that did not commit. Incorrect summaries occur when one transaction is using an aggregate function to summarize data stored in a database while a second transaction is making modifications to the database, causing the summary to include incorrect information. SQL injection is a web application security flaw, not a database concurrency problem. 51 . A. Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides the most effective defense against session hijacking because it encrypts all traffic between the client and server, preventing the attacker from stealing session credentials. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) also encrypts traffic, but it is vulnerable to attacks against its encryption technology. Complex and expiring cookies are a good idea, but they are not sufficient protection against session hijacking. 52 . C. The purpose of the change advisory board (CAB) is to review and then approve or reject proposed code changes. The CAB is not normally involved in the approval of developer credentials, the conduct of lessons learned sessions, or the prioritization of software development efforts. 53 . B. git is a version management tool that is very commonly used by developers to interact with code repositories, 165/220 such as those hosted by GitHub. grep is a command-line tool used to search files for specific content. lsof is a command used to list the open files on a system. gcc is a C language compiler used to transform source code into executable code. 54 . C. The single quotation mark in the input field is a telltale sign that this is a SQL injection attack. The single quotation mark is used to escape outside the SQL code's input field, and the text following it is used to directly manipulate the SQL command sent from the web application to the database. 55 . B. Client-side input validation is not an effective control against any type of attack because the attacker can easily bypass the validation by altering the code on the client. Escaping restricted characters prevents them from being passed to the database, as does parameterization. Limiting database permissions prevents dangerous code from executing. 56 . B. PERT charts use nodes to represent milestones or deliverables and then show the estimated time to move between milestones. Gantt charts use a different format with a row for each task and lines showing the expected duration of the task. Work breakdown structures are an earlier deliverable that divides project work into achievable tasks. Wireframe diagrams are used in application UI design. 57 . D. Regression testing is performed after developers make changes to an application. It reruns a number of test cases and compares the results to baseline results. Orthogonal array testing is a method for generating test cases based on statistical analysis. Pattern testing uses records of past software bugs to inform the analysis. Matrix testing develops a matrix of all possible inputs and outputs to inform the test plan. 58 . B. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks may take advantage of the use of reflected input in a web application where input provided by one user is displayed to another user. Input validation is a control used to prevent XSS attacks. XSS does not require an unpatched server or any firewall rules beyond those permitting access to the web application. 59 . A. In a white-box test, the tester has access to full implementation details of the system, including source code, prior to beginning the test. In gray-box testing, the tester has partial knowledge. In black-box testing, the tester has no knowledge of the system and tests it from a user perspective. Blue boxes are a phone hacking tool and are not used in software testing. 60 . C. Heuristic-based antimalware software has a higher likelihood of detecting a zero-day exploit than signaturebased methods. Heuristic-based software does not require frequent signature updates because it does not rely upon monitoring systems for the presence of known malware. The trade-off with this approach is that it has a higher false positive rate than signature detection methods. 61 . D. One possibility for the clean scan results is that the virus is using stealth techniques, such as intercepting read requests from the antivirus software and returning a correct-looking version of the infected file. The system may also be the victim of a zero-day attack, using a virus that is not yet included in the signature definition files provided by the antivirus vendor. 62 . A. In URL encoding, the . character is replaced by %252E, and the / character is replaced by %252F. You can see this in the log entry, where the expected pattern of ../../ is replaced by %252E%252E%252F%252E%252E%252F . 63 . C. Attacks where the malicious user tricks the victim's web browser into executing a script through the use of a third-party site are known as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This particular attack is a persistent XSS attack because it remains on the discussion forum until an administrator discovers and deletes it, giving it the ability to affect many users. 64 . C. The Agile Manifesto includes 12 principles for software development. Three of those are listed as answer choices: maximizing the amount of work not done is essential, build projects around motivated individuals, and welcome changing requirements throughout the development process. Agile does not, however, consider clear documentation the primary measure of progress. Instead, working software is the primary measure of progress. 65 . B. Each change should be the result of a reviewed and approved request for change (RFC). These RFCs may be approved by the change advisory board (CAB). The security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platforms used by the organization would not normally contain information about the change management process. 66 . D. A key-value store is an example of a NoSQL database that does not follow a relational or hierarchical model like traditional databases. A graph database is another example of a NoSQL database, but it uses nodes and edges to store data rather than keys and values. 67 . C. A database failure in the middle of a transaction causes the rollback of the entire transaction. In this scenario, the database would not execute either command because doing so would violate the atomicity property of the transaction. 68 . B. When using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software, customers do not generally have access to the source code and must depend upon the vendor to release security patches that correct vulnerabilities. Other controls, such as intrusion prevention systems and firewalls, may be able to help mitigate the issue, depending upon the nature of the flaw, but they will not correct it. 69 . B. Static testing performs code analysis in an offline fashion, without actually executing the code. Dynamic testing evaluates code in a runtime environment. Both static and dynamic testing may use automated tools, and both are important security testing techniques. 70 . D. The chart shown in the figure is a Gantt chart, showing the proposed start and end dates for different activities. It is developed based on the work breakdown structure (WBS), which is developed based on functional requirements. Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) charts show the project schedule as a series of numbered nodes. 71 . D. In a gray-box test, the tester evaluates the software from a user perspective but has access to the source code as the test is conducted. White-box tests also have access to the source code but perform testing from a developer's perspective. Black-box tests work from a user's perspective but do not have access to source code. Blue boxes are a telephone hacking tool and not a software testing technique. 72 . D. The Time of Check to Time of Use (TOC/TOU) attack exploits timing differences between when a system verifies authorization and software uses that authorization to perform an action. It is an example of a race condition attack. The other three attacks mentioned do not depend on precise timing. 73 . D. Each of these input parameters makes up part of the attack surface of the application. Attackers may opt to target any of them to attack the code or its supporting infrastructure. 74 . B. Threat modeling commonly involves decomposing the application to understand it and how it interacts with other components or users. Next, identifying and ranking threats allows you to focus on the threats that should be prioritized. Finally, identifying how to mitigate those threats finishes the process. Once complete, an 166/220 organization can take action to handle the threats that were identified with appropriate controls. 75 . D. The fail closed approach prevents any activity from taking place during a system security failure and is the most conservative approach to failure management. Fail open takes the opposite philosophy, allowing all activity in the event of a security control failure. Fail clear and fail mitigation are not failure management approaches. 76 . D. The illustration shows the spiral model of software development. In this approach, developers use multiple iterations of a waterfall-style software development process. This becomes a “loop” of iterations through similar processes. The original waterfall approach does not iterate through the entire process repeatedly. Some variants do allow iteration, but only by allowing movement backward and forward one stage. The Agile approach to software development focuses on iterative improvement and does not follow a rigorous SDLC model. Lean is a process improvement methodology and not a software development model. 77 . D. In a software-as-a-service solution, the vendor manages both the physical infrastructure and the complete application stack, providing the customer with access to a fully managed application. 78 . A. The request process begins with a user-initiated request for a feature. Change and release control are initiated by developers seeking to implement changes. Design review is a phase of the change approval process initiated by developers when they have a completed design. 79 . C. Polyinstantiation allows the storage of multiple different pieces of information in a database at different classification levels to prevent attackers from inferring anything about the absence of information. Input validation, server-side validation, and parameterization are all techniques used to prevent web application attacks and are not effective against inference attacks. 80 . C. While Ursula may certainly use an object model, data dictionary, and primary key in her development effort, external developers cannot directly use them to access her code. An application programming interface (API) allows other developers to call Ursula's code from within their own without knowing the details of Ursula's implementation. 81 . C. This is an example of software-defined security (SDS), where security infrastructure may be easily manipulated by code. Answering this question is tricky because several of the other terms are closely related. Software-defined security is an example of infrastructure as code (IaC), but SDS is a more descriptive, and therefore better, answer. SDS is commonly used within an Agile development framework. The DevOps approach links together development and operations but is generally called DevSecOps when it also includes SDS. 82 . D. Messages similar to the one shown here are indicative of a ransomware attack. The attacker encrypts files on a user's hard drive and then demands a ransom, normally paid in Bitcoin, for the decryption key required to restore access to the original content. Encrypted viruses, on the other hand, use encryption to hide themselves from antivirus mechanisms and do not alter other contents on the system. 83 . D. Despite many organizations moving to Agile, DevOps, or other more responsive development methodologies, waterfall remains a strong contender when clear objectives and stable requirements are combined with a need to prevent flaws and to have a high level of control over the development process and output. 84 . D. Neural networks attempt to use complex computational techniques to model the behavior of the human mind. Knowledge banks are a component of expert systems, which are designed to capture and reapply human knowledge. Decision support systems are designed to provide advice to those carrying out standard procedures and are often driven by expert systems. 85 . B. In level 2, the Repeatable level of the SW-CMM, an organization introduces basic life cycle management processes. Reuse of code in an organized fashion begins, and repeatable results are expected from similar projects. The key process areas for this level include Requirements Management, Software Project Planning, Software Project Tracking and Oversight, Software Subcontract Management, Software Quality Assurance, and Software Configuration Management. 86 . C. The critical fact in this question is that Lucas suspects the tampering took place before the employee departed. This is the signature of a logic bomb: malicious code that lies dormant until certain conditions are met. The other attack types listed here—privilege escalation, SQL injection, and remote code execution—would more likely take place in real time. 87 . A. The Agile approach to software development embraces four principles. It values individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. 88 . C. API developers commonly use API keys to limit access to authorized users and applications. Encryption provides for confidentiality of information exchanged using an API but does not provide authentication. Input validation is an application security technique used to protect against malicious input. IP filters may be used to limit access to an API, but they are not commonly used because it is difficult to deploy an API with IP filters since the filters require constant modification and maintenance as endpoints change. 89 . D. An audit kickoff meeting should clearly describe the scope and purpose of the audit as well as the expected time frame. Auditors should never approach an audit with any expectations about what they will discover because the findings should be developed based only upon the results of audit examinations. 90 . B. In the waterfall model, the software development process follows five sequential steps that are, in order, Requirements, Design, Coding, Testing, and Maintenance. Note that these phases may be further subdivided. The Requirements phase often begins with System Requirements and then moves on to Software Requirements. The Design phase often begins with Preliminary Design and then moves on to Detailed Design. 91 . C. In a platform-as-a-service solution, the customer supplies application code that the vendor then executes on its own infrastructure. 92 . D. Input validation ensures that the data provided to a program as input matches the expected parameters. Limit checks are a special form of input validation that ensure that the value remains within an expected range, but there was no range specified in this scenario. Fail open and fail secure are options when planning for possible system failures. 93 . B, D. Dynamic application security tools conduct their testing by actually executing the code. This is the case for both fuzzing and web application vulnerability scanning. Code reviews and static analysis packages analyze the code itself but do not execute it, making them static application security testing (SAST) tools. 94 . C. The DevOps approach to technology management seeks to integrate software development, operations, and quality assurance in a seamless approach that builds collaboration between the three disciplines. 95 . A. Deploying a web application firewall (WAF) may reduce the likelihood or impact of a web application 167/220 vulnerability and is, therefore, a good example of risk mitigation. Encryption is also a risk mitigation control, but it is less likely be effective against a web application security flaw. Purchasing an insurance policy is an example of risk transference, not risk mitigation. Discontinuing use of the software is an example of risk avoidance, not risk mitigation. 96 . D. Dirty reads occur when one transaction reads a value from a database that was written by another transaction that did not commit. Lost updates occur when one transaction writes a value to the database that overwrites a value needed by transactions that have earlier precedence, causing those transactions to read an incorrect value. Incorrect summaries occur when one transaction is using an aggregate function to summarize data stored in a database, while a second transaction is making modifications to the database, causing the summary to include incorrect information. SQL injection is a web application security flaw, not a database concurrency problem. 97 . A. The integrated product team (IPT) approach brought together cross-functional teams and was designed by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1995. It was a predecessor to the Agile methodology, which uses tools like the scrum approach and user stories to conduct software development work. 98 . B. Storage is an infrastructure component and, therefore, a block storage service is an example of an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud service. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) models provide full applications managed by the provider. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and function-as-a-service (FaaS) approaches allow developers to run their own code on an infrastructure platform managed by the provider. 99 . The code testing methods match to their definitions as follows: 1 . Regression testing: C. A testing method that is used to verify that previously tested software performs the same way after changes are made 2 . Integration testing: D. A testing method used to validate how software modules work together 3 . Unit testing: B. A testing method that focuses on modules or smaller sections of code for testing 4 . System testing: A. Testing on a complete integrated product 100 . The terms match to their definitions as follows: 1 . Session hijacking: C. An exploitation method that often involves cookies or keys to gain unauthorized access to a computer or service 2 . Cross-site scripting: A. An attack that injects a malicious script into otherwise trusted websites 3 . Cross-site request forgery: D. An attack that forces a user to execute unwanted actions in a website or application they are currently logged into 4 . SQL injection: B. An attack that is designed to execute commands against a database via an insecure web application Chapter 9: Practice Test 1 1 . A, B, D. Packets with public IP addresses will routinely be allowed to enter the network, so you should not create a rule to block them. Packets with internal source addresses should never originate from outside the network, so they should be blocked from entering the network. Packets with external source addresses should never be found on the internal network, so they should be blocked from leaving the network. Finally, private IP addresses should never be used on the Internet, so packets containing private IP addresses should be blocked from leaving the network. 2 . B. A content distribution network (CDN) is designed to provide reliable, low-latency, geographically distributed content distribution. In this scenario, a CDN is an ideal solution. A P2P CDN like BitTorrent isn't a typical choice for a commercial entity, whereas redundant servers or a hot site can provide high availability but won't provide the remaining requirements. 3 . A, B, C. A forensic disk controller performs four functions. One of those, write blocking, intercepts write commands sent to the device and prevents them from modifying data on the device. The other three functions include returning data requested by a read operation, returning access-significant information from the device, and reporting errors from the device back to the forensic host. The controller should not prevent read commands from being sent to the device because those commands may return crucial information. 4 . B. RAID 1, disk mirroring, requires two physical disks that will contain copies of the same data. 5 . D. The TGS, or ticket-granting service (which is usually on the same server as the KDC), receives a TGT from the client. It validates the TGT and the user's rights to access the service they are requesting to use. The TGS then issues a ticket and session keys to the client. The AS serves as the authentication server, which forwards the username to the KDC. It's worth noting that the client doesn't communicate with the KDC directly. Instead, it will communicate with the TGT and the AS, which means KDC isn't an appropriate answer here. 6 . C. This is an example of a civil investigation because it relates to a contract dispute and will likely wind up being litigated in civil court. Administrative investigations are for internal purposes and are not applicable when a third party is being investigated. Criminal and regulatory investigations may only be initiated by those with regulatory authority, typically government agencies. 7 . C. Wave pattern motion detectors transmit ultrasonic or microwave signals into the monitored area, watching for changes in the returned signals bouncing off objects. Infrared heat-based detectors watch for unusual heat patterns. Capacitance detectors work based upon electromagnetic fields. 8 . C. Stateful packet inspection firewalls, also known as dynamic packet filtering firewalls, track the state of a conversation and can allow a response from a remote system based on an internal system being allowed to start the communication. Static packet filtering and circuit-level gateways only filter based on source and destination IP addresses and ports along with the protocol being used, whereas application-level gateway firewalls proxy traffic for specific applications. 9 . B. A captive portal can require those who want to connect to and use Wi-Fi to provide an email address to connect. This allows Ben to provide easy-to-use wireless while meeting his business purposes. WPA2-PSK is the preshared key mode of WPA and won't provide information about users who are given a key. WPA3's SAE mode would be preferable to WPA2-PSK, but it still does not allow for the data gathering Ben desires. Sharing a password doesn't allow for data gathering either. 10 . B. Many modern wireless routers can provide multiple SSIDs. Ben can create a private, secure network for his business operations, but he will need to make sure that the customer and business networks are firewalled or otherwise logically separated from each other. Running WPA3 on the same SSID isn't possible without creating 168/220 another wireless network and would cause confusion for customers (SSIDs aren't required to be unique). Running a network in Enterprise mode isn't used for open networks, and WEP is outdated and incredibly vulnerable. 11 . D. Unencrypted open networks broadcast traffic in the clear. This means that unencrypted sessions to websites can be easily captured with a packet sniffer. Some tools like FireSheep have been specifically designed to capture sessions from popular websites. Fortunately, many websites now use TLS by default, but other sites still send user session information in the clear. Shared passwords are not the cause of the vulnerability, ARP spoofing isn't an issue with wireless networks, and a Trojan is designed to look like safe software, not to compromise a router. 12 . C. It is possible that Kevin could use any one of these documents. We should zero in on the portion of the question where it indicates that these are best practices. This implies that the advice is not mandatory and, therefore, would not go into a policy or standard. The fact that the advice is general in nature means that it is likely not well-suited to the step-by-step nature of a procedure. A guideline would be the perfect place to document these best practices. 13 . D. Clipping is an analysis technique that reports alerts only after they exceed a set threshold. It is a specific form of sampling, which is a more general term that describes any attempt to excerpt records for review. Thresholding is not a commonly used term. Administrators may choose to configure automatic or manual account lockout after failed login attempts, but that is not described in the scenario. 14 . B. RADIUS is a common AAA technology used to provide services for dial-up, wireless networks, network devices, and a range of other systems. OAuth is an authorization protocol used to allow applications to act on a user's behalf without sharing the password and is used for many web applications. OpenID Connect is an authentication layer on top of OAuth that allows clients to verify the identity of an end user. XTACACS, an earlier protocol for network authentication, has largely been superseded by more secure and robust protocols like RADIUS, and its proprietary nature does not fit Sally's criteria. 15 . C. In an inference attack, the attacker uses several pieces of generic nonsensitive information to determine a specific sensitive value. In a salami slicing attack, the attacker siphons off minute quantities of money many times to accumulate a large amount of funds. In a data diddling attack, the attacker alters the contents of a database. Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology to achieve their goals. 16 . A. The Take rule in the Take-Grant protection model allows a subject to take rights from another object if the subject has the take right over that object. In this scenario, if Alice has the take right over Bob and Bob has read permissions on an object, Alice can use the Take rule to grant herself the read permissions that Bob possesses. The Grant rule is for granting rights to other subjects, not for taking them for oneself. The Create rule is used to create new objects or rights, not to transfer existing ones. There is no Remote rule in the Take-Grant protection model. 17 . B. Brute-force attacks try every possible password. In this attack, the password is changing by one letter at each attempt, which indicates that it is a brute-force attack. A dictionary attack would use dictionary words for the attack, whereas a man-in-the-middle or pass-the-hash attack would most likely not be visible in an authentication log except as a successful login. 18 . B. Isolation requires that transactions operate separately from each other. Atomicity ensures that if any part of a database transaction fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back as if it never occurred. Consistency ensures that all transactions are consistent with the logical rules of the database, such as having a primary key. Durability requires that once a transaction is committed to the database it must be preserved. Together, these properties make up the ACID model. 19 . B. Worms have built-in propagation mechanisms that do not require user interaction, such as scanning for systems containing known vulnerabilities and then exploiting those vulnerabilities to gain access. Viruses and Trojan horses typically require user interaction to spread. Logic bombs do not spread from system to system but lie in wait until certain conditions are met, triggering the delivery of their payload. 20 . B, C. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a U.S. law governing the healthcare sector that does provide for criminal penalties. The Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX) Act governs publicly traded corporations and also provides for criminal penalties. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a U.S. law governing educational records, but it does not provide for criminal penalties. PCI DSS, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, is an industry standard for payment card operations and handling. Because it is not a law, PCI DSS violations cannot incur criminal sanctions. 21 . C. The TCP three-way handshake consists of an initial contact via a SYN, or synchronize flagged packet, which receives a response with a SYN/ACK, or synchronize and acknowledge flagged packet, which is acknowledged by the original sender with an ACK, or acknowledge packet. RST is used in TCP to reset a connection, PSH is used to send data immediately, and FIN is used to end a connection. 22 . A, C, D. MDM products do not have the capability of assuming control of a device not currently managed by the organization. This would be equivalent to hacking into a device owned by someone else and might constitute a crime. They do normally provide the ability to manage device backups, enforce the use of encryption, and remotely wipe the contents of mobile devices. 23 . A. Identity as a service (IDaaS) provides an identity platform as a third-party service. This can provide benefits, including integration with cloud services and removing overhead for maintenance of traditional on-premises identity systems but can also create risk due to third-party control of identity services and reliance on an off-site identity infrastructure. 24 . A. Gina's actions harm the CISSP certification and information security community by undermining the integrity of the examination process. While Gina also is acting dishonestly, the harm to the profession is more of a direct violation of the ISC2 Code of Ethics. 25 . A. The annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is the amount of damage that the organization expects to occur each year as the result of a given risk. ALE is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE), which is the expected financial loss from a single flooding event, by the annual rate of occurrence (ARO), which is the expected frequency of flooding events per year. The ALE helps organizations to understand the potential impact of risks and to make informed decisions about risk mitigation strategies and investments in protective measures. The exposure factor (EF) is the percentage of the asset expected to be damaged during an incident. 26 . C. The whitelisting approach to application control allows users to install only those software packages specifically approved by administrators. This would be an appropriate approach in a scenario where application installation needs to be tightly controlled. Blacklisting, which blocks known malicious or unauthorized 169/220 applications, would not be as effective in this scenario because it allows all software to run unless it appears on the blacklist. Graylisting and bluelisting are made-up terms. 27 . A. This is a clear example of a denial-of-service attack—denying legitimate users authorized access to the system through the use of overwhelming traffic. It goes beyond a reconnaissance attack because the attacker is affecting the system, but it is not a compromise because the attacker did not attempt to gain access to the system. There is no reason to believe that a malicious insider was involved. 28 . A. The Company ID column is likely unique for each row in the table, making it the best choice for a primary key. There may be multiple companies that share the same name or ZIP code. Similarly, a single sales representative likely serves more than one company, making those fields unsuitable for use as a unique identifier. 29 . C. Personally identifiable information (PII) includes data that can be used to distinguish or trace that person's identity and also includes their educational, financial, and employment information. PHI is personal health information, EDI is electronic data interchange, and proprietary data is used to maintain an organization's competitive advantage. 30 . D. 129.53.44.124 is a valid public IP address and a legitimate destination for traffic leaving Bob's network. 12.8.195.15 is a public address on Bob's network and should not be a destination address on a packet leaving the network. 10.8.15.9 and 192.168.109.55 are both private IP addresses that should not be routed to the Internet. 31 . D. Binary keyspaces contain a number of keys equal to 2 raised to the power of the number of bits. Two to the eighth power is 256, so the keyspace will increase by a factor of 256. 32 . A, B, C, D. Traditional office shredding machines may be used for the disposal of paper records and, depending upon their grade, may also be able to shred credit cards. Industrial shredders are capable of destroying larger pieces of equipment, including removable media and both traditional and SSD hard drives. 33 . A. Encrypting the files reduces the probability that the data will be successfully stolen, so it is an example of risk mitigation. Deleting the files would be risk avoidance. Purchasing insurance would be risk transference. Taking no action would be risk acceptance. 34 . C. Sampling should be done randomly to avoid human bias. Sampling is an effective process if it is done on a truly random sample of sufficient size to provide effective coverage of the userbase. It is infeasible for a single person to review every single record. In an organization of 50,000 users with a 24% annual turnover, it is likely that at least 1,000 of those records have changed in the last month. This is still too many records to review. Asking account administrators to select the records to review is a conflict of interest, as they are the group being audited. 35 . A. In the case of an involuntary termination under adverse circumstances, the user is being fired and may have a negative and potentially hostile reaction. For this reason, it is important to terminate access immediately upon the user being informed of the termination. Terminating access prior to notification may tip the user off to the termination in advance. Leaving access privileges available after termination poses a risk of malicious insider activity. 36 . C. The file clearly shows HTTP requests, as evidenced by the many GET commands. Therefore, this is an example of an application log from an HTTP server. 37 . A. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized approach to rating the severity of vulnerabilities and would be the most helpful tool for Roger's work. The STRIDE and ATT&CK models are used to classify the nature, not the severity, of threats. The PASTA model is designed to help with countermeasure selection. 38 . B. Social engineering exploits humans to allow attacks to succeed. Since help-desk employees are specifically tasked with being helpful, they may be targeted by attackers posing as legitimate employees. Trojans are a type of malware, whereas phishing is a targeted attack via electronic communication methods intended to capture passwords or other sensitive data. Whaling is a type of phishing aimed at high-profile or important targets. 39 . B. If the vendor operates with reasonable security procedures, it is unlikely that the devices will be tampered with at the vendor's site. Similarly, if Greg's organization has reasonable security procedures, tampering at his site is also unlikely. Misconfiguration by an administrator is always possible, but this is a post-installation risk and not a supply chain risk. It is possible that devices will be intercepted and tampered with while in transit from the vendor to Greg's organization. 40 . C. In a single-level security environment, systems should be assigned the classification level of the highest classification of information they are ever expected to process. Systems may not process information that is above their classification level without reclassifying the system upward. 41 . C. A hybrid authentication service can provide authentication services both in the cloud and on-premises, ensuring that service outages due to interrupted links are minimized. An on-site service would continue to work during an Internet outage but would not allow the e-commerce website to authenticate. A cloud service would leave the corporate location offline. Outsourcing authentication does not indicate whether the solution is on- or off-premises and thus isn't a useful answer. 42 . C. Federation links identity information between multiple organizations. Federating with a business partner can allow identification and authorization to occur between them, making integration much easier. Single sign-on would reduce the number of times a user has to log in but will not facilitate the sharing of identity information. Multifactor authentication can help secure authentication but again doesn't help integrate with a third party. Finally, an identity as a service provider might provide federation but doesn't guarantee it. 43 . B. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is frequently used to integrate cloud services and provides the ability to make authentication and authorization assertions. Active Directory integrations are possible but are less common for cloud service providers, and RADIUS is not typically used for integrations like this. Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML) is used to provision users, resources, and services, not for authentication and authorization. 44 . B. Rainbow tables use precomputed password hashes to conduct cracking attacks against password files. They may be frustrated by the use of salting, which adds a specified value to the password prior to hashing, making it much more difficult to perform precomputation. Password expiration policies, password complexity policies, and user education may all contribute to password security, but they are not direct defenses against the use of rainbow tables. 45 . C. A honeypot is a decoy computer system used to bait intruders into attacking. A honeynet is a network of multiple honeypots that creates a more sophisticated environment for intruders to explore. A pseudoflaw is a 170/220 false vulnerability in a system that may attract an attacker. A darknet is a segment of unused network address space that should have no network activity and, therefore, may be easily used to monitor for illicit activity. 46 . C. The false acceptance rate (FAR) is the rate at which the system inadvertently admits an unauthorized user, while the false rejection rate (FRR) is the rate at which the system inadvertently rejects an authorized user. Both the FAR and FRR may be modified by adjusting the sensitivity of the system. The crossover error rate (CER) is the point where both the false acceptance rate and the false rejection rate cross. The CER is less subject to manipulation and is, therefore, the best metric to use for evaluating systems. The FDR is not a metric used to evaluate authentication systems. 47 . C. Steganography is the art of using cryptographic techniques to embed secret messages within other content. Steganographic algorithms work by making invisible alterations to files, such as modifying the least significant bits of the many bits that make up image files. VPNs may be used to obscure secret communications, but they provide protection in transit and can't be used to embed information in an image. Watermarking does embed information in an image but with the intent of protecting intellectual property. A still image would not be used for a covert timing channel because it is a fixed file. 48 . A. JavaScript is an interpreted language so the code is not compiled prior to execution, allowing Roger to inspect the contents of the code. C, C++, and Java are all compiled languages—a compiler produces an executable file that is not human-readable. 49 . D. When a system is configured to use shadowed passwords, the /etc/passwd file contains only the character x in the place of a password. It would not contain any passwords, in either plaintext, encrypted, or hashed form. 50 . C. The end-of-life (EOL) date for a product is normally the date that the vendor will stop selling a product. It is reasonable to continue using the product as long as support remains available. Rob should begin making plans to discontinue use of the product, pending the announcement of an end-of-support (EOS) date. 51 . D. The due care principle states that an individual should react in a situation using the same level of care that would be expected from any reasonable person. It is a very broad standard. The due diligence principle is a more specific component of due care that states that an individual assigned a responsibility should exercise due care to complete it accurately and in a timely manner. Least privilege says that an individual should have the minimum set of permissions necessary to carry out their work. Separation of duties says that no single person should have the right to perform two distinct tasks, which, when combined, constitute a highly privileged action. 52 . A. Information should be classified based upon its sensitivity. This may be due to the value of the information to the organization, the damage caused if lost or compromised, or other factors. The source of the information is one possible contributing factor to the sensitivity level. The likelihood of loss or theft is a component of risk but does not contribute to the classification level. 53 . A. All of these controls are good practices for protecting sensitive information. However, Perry is most concerned about the risk of interception while in transit over the Internet. Transport encryption would, therefore, be the most appropriate control, as anyone intercepting the information would be unable to read its contents. Storage encryption would protect against the theft of information at rest, rather than in transit over a network. Classification and labeling would not protect against interception. Data loss prevention technology may block the transfer entirely and would not meet the business requirement if it blocked the transmission and would not meet the security requirement if it did not detect the data transfer. 54 . B, D. Tangible asset inventories include physical items owned by the organization. This would include server hardware and mobile devices. Intellectual property and files stored on a server are not tangible property and would instead be included in an intangible asset inventory. 55 . D. The Physical layer deals with the electrical impulses or optical pulses that are sent as bits to convey data. This is the layer where cable tapping would occur. Attacks at the Data Link, Network, or Transport layers would involve higher levels of activity in the OSI model, such as compromising a device and using a protocol analyzer to sniff network traffic. 56 . A. In an IaaS server environment, the customer retains responsibility for most server security operations under the shared responsibility model. This includes managing OS security settings, maintaining host firewalls, and configuring server access control. The vendor would be responsible for all security mechanisms at the hypervisor layer and below. 57 . B. Proactive monitoring, aka synthetic monitoring, uses recorded or generated traffic to test systems and software. Passive monitoring uses a network span, tap, or other device to capture traffic to be analyzed. Reactive and replay are not industry terms for types of monitoring. 58 . A. Kailey should consult her organization's record retentions policy to determine the appropriate length of time to preserve the records. The organization may be subject to tax requirements in this regard, and many accountants recommend preserving records for at least seven years, but the organization's own requirements may be stricter than these requirements. 59 . B. The use of an electromagnetic coil inside the card indicates that this is a proximity card. 60 . C. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. The read-through is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a read-through, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a specific scenario without making any changes to information systems. 61 . B. The Agile approach to software development embraces 12 core principles, found in the Agile Manifesto. One of these principles is that the best architecture, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. Another is that teams should welcome changing requirements at any step in the process. A third is that simplicity is essential. The Agile approach emphasizes delivering software frequently, not infrequently. 62 . B. Hand geometry scanners assess the physical dimensions of an individual's hand but do not verify other unique factors about the individual, or even verify if they are alive. This means that hand geometry scanners should not be implemented as the sole authentication factor for secure environments. Hand geometry scanners do not have an abnormally high FRR and do not stand out as a particular issue from an accessibility standpoint compared to other biometric systems. 63 . A. The maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) is the amount of time that a business may be without a service 171/220 before irreparable harm occurs. This measure is sometimes also called maximum tolerable outage (MTO) or maximum allowable downtime (MAD). The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) are related but distinct measures. The RPO focuses on data loss, indicating the maximum period in which data might be lost due to a disruption, and is used to establish the frequency of backups. The RTO, meanwhile, is the target time set for the recovery of IT and business activities after a disruption, aimed to be within the MTD but is not itself a measure of the direct impact on the business operation. The annual loss expectancy (ALE) is not directly related to service interruption but is a metric used in risk assessment to quantify potential annual financial loss from risks. 64 . C. Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) are designed to enforce security policies consistently across cloud services and would best meet Bailey's needs. Data loss prevention (DLP) and digital rights management (DRM) solutions may be able to detect, block, and control some use of information in the cloud, but they would not provide a way to consistently enforce security policies across cloud platforms. Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are designed to detect and block malicious activity and would not be relevant in this scenario. 65 . A, D. Organizations should always label classified information in whatever form, paper or electronic, that it appears. This allows employees to apply proper handling procedures. It is also a common practice to encrypt sensitive information both at rest and in transit. Organizations should grant access to classified information on a need-to-know basis. Automatically granting access to information, whether it is to a visitor or a senior executive, should not occur. 66 . B. Masquerading (or impersonation) attacks use stolen or falsified credentials to bypass authentication mechanisms. That term does describe this attack, but you should keep reading the answer choices even after finding a possible correct answer. In this case, replay attacks are a more specific type of masquerading attack that relies on captured authentication tokens, and this is, therefore, a better answer. Spoofing attacks rely on falsifying an identity like an IP address or hostname without credentials. Modification attacks occur when captured packets are modified and replayed to a system to attempt to perform an action. 67 . A. OpenID Connect is an authentication layer that works with OAuth 2.0 as its underlying authorization framework. It has been widely adopted by cloud service providers and is widely supported. SAML, RADIUS, and Kerberos are alternative authentication technologies but do not have the same level of seamless integration with OAuth 2.0. 68 . C. This scenario describes separation of duties—not allowing the same person to hold two roles that, when combined, are sensitive. While two-person control is a similar concept, it does not apply in this case because the scenario does not say that either action requires the concurrence of two users. Least privilege says that an individual should have the minimum set of permissions necessary to carry out their work. Job rotation moves people through jobs on a periodic basis to deter fraud. 69 . C. The parol evidence rule states that when an agreement between two parties is put into written form, it is assumed to be the entire agreement unless amended in writing. The best evidence rule says that a copy of a document is not admissible if the original document is available. Real evidence and testimonial evidence are evidence types, not rules of evidence. 70 . A. Network Address Translation (NAT) translates an internal address to an external address. VLANs are used to logically divide networks, BGP is a routing protocol, and G/NAT is a made-up term. 71 . B, C, D. SSAE-18 does not assert specific controls. Instead, it reviews the use and application of controls in an audited organization. It is an attestation standard, used for external audits, and forms part of the underlying framework for SOC 1, 2, and 3 reports. 72 . A. When creating a digital signature, the sender of a message always encrypts the message digest with their own private key. The recipient (or any third party) may then verify the digital signature by decrypting it with the sender's public key and then comparing that decrypted signature with a message digest that the recipient computes themselves. 73 . B. The recovery time objective (RTO) is the amount of time expected to return an IT service or component to operation after a failure. The maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) is the longest amount of time that an IT service or component may be unavailable without causing serious damage to the organization. The recovery point objective (RPO) identifies the maximum amount of data, measured in time, that may be lost during a recovery effort. Service-level agreements (SLAs) are written contracts that document service expectations. 74 . C. Change management typically requires sign-off from a manager or supervisor before changes are made. This helps to ensure proper awareness and communication. SDN stands for software-defined networking, release management is the process that new software releases go through to be accepted, and versioning is used to differentiate versions of software, code, or other objects. 75 . B. Wet pipe suppression systems have water present in the pipes at all times, posing an unacceptable level of risk for a data center containing electronics that might be damaged if a pipe leaks. Dry pipe and pre-action systems only contain water when triggered in the event of a possible fire. FM-200 is a chemical suppressant commonly used in place of water in data centers. 76 . D. Notifications and procedures like the signs posted at the company Chris works for are examples of directive access controls. Detective controls are designed to operate after the fact. The doors and the locks on them are examples of physical controls. Preventive controls are designed to stop an event and could also include the locks that are present on the doors. 77 . B, D. Deterrent controls seek to prevent an intruder from attempting an attack in the first place. Guard dogs have an intimidating presence that serves this purpose well. They do also serve to deny, detect, and delay intrusions depending upon their training. Lighting also deters attacks by making potential intrusions more visible, reducing the likelihood that an intruder will enter a well-lit area. Access control vestibules (also known as mantraps) are intended to deny intruders access, rather than deter attempts. Motion detectors are intended to detect intruders rather than deter them. 78 . B. This is an example of function-as-a-service (FaaS) computing. However, FaaS is not listed as an answer choice, so you must also know that FaaS is a subcategory of platform-as-a-service (PaaS) computing to answer this question correctly. This model does not necessarily take advantage of containerization. The cloud provider is managing the infrastructure and only making the platform available to customers, so it is not infrastructure as a service (IaaS). The customers are running their own code, so it is not software as a service (SaaS). 79 . C, D. The attacker may attempt to perform frequency analysis or a brute-force attack against the large volume 172/220 of encrypted ciphertext. As the attacker does not have access to the plaintext information, a known plaintext attack is not possible. The attacker also does not have the ability to encrypt information, so they cannot use a chosen ciphertext attack. 80 . B. Provisioning that occurs through an established workflow, such as through an HR process, is workflowbased account provisioning. If Alex had set up accounts for his new hire on the systems he manages, he would have been using discretionary account provisioning. If the provisioning system allowed the new hire to sign up for an account on their own, they would have used self-service account provisioning, and if there was a central, software-driven process, rather than HR forms, it would have been automated account provisioning. 81 . C. As Alex has changed roles, he retained access to systems that he no longer administers. The provisioning system has provided rights to workstations and the application servers he manages, but he should not have access to the databases he no longer administers. Privilege levels are not specified, so we can't determine if he has excessive privileges. Logging may or may not be enabled, but it isn't possible to tell from the diagram or problem. 82 . C. When a user's role changes, they should be provisioned based on their role and other access entitlements. De-provisioning and re-provisioning are time-consuming and can lead to problems with changed IDs and how existing credentials work. Simply adding new rights leads to privilege creep, and matching another user's rights can lead to excessive privileges due to privilege creep for that other user. 83 . B. EAL2 assurance applies when the system has been structurally tested. It is the second-to-lowest level of assurance under the Common Criteria. 84 . C. Before granting any user access to information, Adam should verify that the user has an appropriate security clearance as well as a business need to know for the information in question. 85 . B. During the preservation phase, the organization ensures that information related to the matter at hand is protected against intentional or unintentional alteration or deletion. The identification phase locates relevant information but does not preserve it. The collection phase occurs after preservation and gathers responsive information. The processing phase performs a rough cut of the collected information for relevance. 86 . C. The original version of RIPEMD and the MD5 hash algorithms have known vulnerabilities and should no longer be used. SHA-2 and SHA-3 are both considered secure today and provide the same level of security."
SHA-3,"is, however, less efficient than SHA-2, making SHA-2 the better choice for Dana's needs. 87 . D. In the subject/object model, the object is the resource being requested by a subject. In this example, Harry would like access to the document, making the document the object of the request. 88 . C. The process of removing a header (and possibly a footer) from the data received from a previous layer in the OSI model is known as de-encapsulation. Encapsulation occurs when the header or footer is added. Payloads are the data portion of a packet, but payloading is not a technical term. Similarly, packet unwrapping is a made-up term. 89 . A. CPTED implements three strategies: natural access control, natural surveillance, and natural territorial reinforcement. Natural access control uses barricades and other physical elements to create a separation between secure and insecure spaces. Natural surveillance designs the environment to expose potential intruders to natural scrutiny by legitimate occupants. Natural territorial reinforcement uses fences, signs, and other elements to clearly define secure spaces. Natural intrusion detection is not an element of CPTED. 90 . C. If Shahla's organization expands into Canada and handles personally identifiable information as part of its routine business, the most likely new law to affect the organization would be the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). This Canadian federal privacy law governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in the course of commercial business. PIPL is China's Personal Information Protection Law, POPIA is South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act, and the CCPA is the California Consumer Privacy Act. Each of these laws governs the handling of personal information within their respective jurisdictions, but would not be the primary concern for a U.S. organization considering expansion into Canada. 91 . D. The use of a probability/impact matrix is the hallmark of a qualitative risk assessment. It uses subjective measures of probability and impact, such as “high,” “moderate,” and “low,” in place of quantitative measures. 92 . B. Mandatory access control systems can be hierarchical, where each domain is ordered and related to other domains above and below it; compartmentalized, where there is no relationship between each domain; or hybrid, where both hierarchy and compartments are used. There is no concept of bracketing in mandatory access control design. 93 . B. Asymmetric encryption algorithms require two keys per user, regardless of the number of participants. Therefore, this six-member team would require 12 keys. If this team were to use symmetric cryptography, they would require (n*(n-1))/2, or (6*(6-1))/2 = 15 keys. 94 . B. Category 5e and Category 6 UTP cables are both rated to 1000Mbps. Cat 5 (not Cat 5e) is only rated to 100Mbps, whereas Cat 7 is rated to 10Gbps. There is no Cat 4e. 95 . C. While Ursula may use a variety of different options to meet her needs, the best approach would be the use of a content delivery network (CDN). CDNs are specifically designed for this role, distributing content to many remote endpoints where it may be quickly loaded by local users. 96 . D. Smurf attacks use a distributed attack approach to send ICMP echo replies at a targeted system from many different source addresses. The most effective way to block this attack would be to block inbound ICMP traffic. Blocking the source addresses is not feasible because the attacker would likely simply change the source addresses. Blocking destination addresses would likely disrupt normal activity. The smurf attack does not use UDP, so blocking that traffic would have no effect. 97 . C. Static packet filtering firewalls are known as first-generation firewalls and do not track connection state. Stateful inspection, application proxying, and next-generation firewalls all add connection state tracking capability. 98 . C. All of these controls serve to increase the reliability of power to a server. However, only dual power supplies address hardware issues that arise within the server, allowing the server to continue operation if one of the power supplies fails. Redundant power sources, backup generators, and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) are designed to increase the reliability of power flowing to the server. 99 . A, C. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH) are modern approaches to remote access that include encryption features. Telnet and dial-up are outdated approaches that do not provide encryption and 173/220 should not be relied upon for secure access. 100 . B. Latency is a delay in the delivery of packets from their source to their destination. Jitter is a variation in the latency for different packets. Packet loss is the disappearance of packets in transit that requires retransmission. Interference is electrical noise or other disruptions that corrupt the contents of packets. 101 . A, B, D. It is entirely appropriate to distribute internal audit reports to anyone in the organization who has a valid need to know. This may include both management and individual contributors responsible for remediating issues as well as board members charged with oversight. It would not normally be appropriate to distribute internal audit reports to external entities, such as suppliers and customers. 102 . B. Web applications communicate with web browsers via an interface, making interface testing the best answer here. Regression testing might be used as part of the interface test but is too specific to be the best answer. Similarly, the test might be a white-box, or full knowledge, test, but interface testing better describes this specific example. Fuzzing is less likely a part of a browser compatibility test, as it tests unexpected inputs, rather than functionality. 103 . A. Role-based access control gives each user an array of permissions based on their position in the organization, such as the scheme shown here. Task-based access control is not a standard approach. Rulebased access controls use rules that apply to all subjects, which isn't something we see in the list. Discretionary access control gives object owners rights to choose how the objects they own are accessed, which is not what this list shows. 104 . D. Fire suppression systems do not stop a fire from occurring but do reduce the damage that fires cause. This is an example of reducing risk by lowering the impact of an event. 105 . D. Patents and trade secrets can both protect intellectual property in the form of a process. Patents require public disclosure and have expiration dates, while trade secrets remain in force for as long as they remain secret. Therefore, trade secret protection most closely aligns with the company's goals. 106 . D. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a suite of specifications used to handle vulnerability and security configuration information. The National Vulnerability Database provided by NIST uses SCAP. XACML is the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language, an OASIS standard used for access control decisions, and neither VSML nor SCML is an industry term. 107 . D. Breach and attack simulation (BAS) platforms are intended to automate some aspects of penetration testing. These systems are designed to inject threat indicators onto systems and networks in an effort to trigger other security controls. White-box, gray-box, and black-box testing all involve more significant manual effort. 108 . A. The Simple Security Property prevents an individual from reading information at a higher security level than their clearance allows. This is also known as the “no read up” rule. The Simple Integrity Property says that a subject cannot read an object at a lower integrity level (no read down). The *-Security Property says that users can't write data to a lower security level than their own. The Discretionary Security Property allows the use of a matrix to determine access permissions. 109 . B. The work breakdown structure (WBS) is an important project management tool that divides the work done for a large project into smaller components. It is not a project plan because it does not describe timing or resources. Test analyses are used during later phases of the development effort to report test results. Functional requirements may be included in a work breakdown structure, but they are not the full WBS. 110 . B. Network Access Control (NAC) systems can be used to authenticate users and then validate their system's compliance with a security standard before they are allowed to connect to the network. Enforcing security profiles can help reduce zero-day attacks, making NAC a useful solution. A firewall can't enforce system security policies, whereas an IDS can only monitor for attacks and alarm when they happen. Thus, neither a firewall nor an IDS meets Kolin's needs. Finally, port security is a MAC address-based security feature that can restrict only which systems or devices can connect to a given port. 111 . C. This scenario violates the least privilege principle because an application should never require full administrative rights to run. Gwen should update the service account to have only the privileges necessary to support the application. 112 . B, C, D. Organizations typically use the time to resolve vulnerabilities, the number of account compromises, and the number of attempts by users to visit malicious sites as indicators. The number of scheduled audits is not normally a measure of the performance of an information security team. A more appropriate indicator in this area is the number of repeat audit findings. 113 . A. This is a true positive report because the scan detected the vulnerability, and the vulnerability actually existed. The fact that the team later remediated the vulnerability could be noted in the report, but it does not change the result of the scan or its classification. True negatives occur when scans correctly note the absence of a vulnerability. False positives occur when scans report the presence of a vulnerability that does not actually exist. False negatives occur when scans report that no vulnerability exists when one does, in fact, exist. 114 . C. Test directories often include scripts that may have poor protections or may have other data that can be misused. There is not a default test directory that allows administrative access to PHP. Test directories are not commonly used to store sensitive data, nor is the existence of a test directory a common indicator of compromise. 115 . A. Directory indexing may not initially seem like an issue during a penetration test, but simply knowing the name and location of files can provide an attacker with quite a bit of information about an organization, as well as a list of potentially accessible files. XDRF is not a type of attack, and indexing is not a denial-of-service attack vector. Directory indexing being turned on is typically either due to design or because the server was misconfigured at setup, rather than being a sign of attack. 116 . B. Cross-site tracing (XST) leverages the HTTP TRACE or TRACK methods and could be used to steal a user's cookies via cross-site scripting (XSS). The other options are not industry terms for web application or web server attacks or vulnerabilities. 117 . C. The chief audit executive (CAE) should report to the most senior possible leader to avoid conflicts of interest. Of the choices provided, the chief executive officer (CEO) is the most senior position and the best option. It is also possible to provide an added degree of independence by having the CAE report to the board of directors, either as a primary reporting line or as a dotted line relationship. 118 . C. Data loss prevention (DLP) systems specialize in the identification of sensitive information. In this case, Ursula would like to identify the presence of this information on endpoint devices, so she should choose an endpoint DLP control. Network-based DLP would not detect stored information unless the user transmits it over the network. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are designed to detect and block attacks in progress, not 174/220 necessarily the presence of sensitive information. 119 . B. In the private cloud computing model, the cloud computing environment is dedicated to a single organization and does not follow the shared tenancy model. The environment may be built by the company in its own data center or built by a vendor at a co-location site. 120 . A. Load balancing helps to ensure that a failed server will not take a website or service offline. Dual power supplies only work to prevent failure of a power supply or power source. IPS can help to prevent attacks, and RAID can help prevent a disk failure from taking a system offline. 121 . D. Integrity ensures that unauthorized changes are not made to data while stored or in transit. 122 . C. A star topology uses a central connection device. Ethernet networks may look like a star, but they are actually a logical bus topology that is sometimes deployed in a physical star. 123 . C. Input validation ensures that the data provided to a program as input matches the expected parameters. Limit checks are a special form of input validation that ensure that the value remains within an expected range, as is the case described in this scenario. Fail open and fail secure are options when planning for possible system failures. Buffer bounds are not a type of software control. 124 . The testing methodologies match with the level of knowledge as follows: 1 . Black box: C. No prior knowledge of the system 2 . White box: A. Full knowledge of the system 3 . Gray box: B. Partial or incomplete knowledge 125 . The factors match to the types as follows: 1 . A PIN: 1. Something you know 2 . A token: 2. Something you have 3 . A fingerprint: 3. Something you are 4 . A password: 1. Something you know 5 . A smartcard: 2. Something you have 6 . A retinal scan: 3. Something you are 7 . A security question/answer: 1. Something you know Chapter 10: Practice Test 2 1 . D. The recovery point objective (RPO) identifies the maximum amount of data, measured in time, that may be lost during a recovery effort. The recovery time objective (RTO) is the amount of time expected to return an IT service or component to operation after a failure. The maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) is the longest amount of time that an IT service or component may be unavailable without causing serious damage to the organization. Service-level agreements (SLAs) are written contracts that document service expectations. 2 . C. Due care and due diligence can be a confusing pair of terms to keep straight. Chris is engaging in due diligence when he does the preparation and research. Once that is done, he must use due care while undertaking the actions. This is often described in the context of the prudent person rule: would a prudent person have taken the action given the same knowledge? Compliance efforts work to ensure an organization meets regulatory or other requirements. Organizations typically don't take regulatory action—that's left to the government. 3 . D. Blue teams are defenders, red teams are attackers, and purple teams combine both attack and defense activities. Yellow and green teams are not commonly described as part of penetration testing. 4 . C. Hardware and software can be subject to import and export controls. In the case of AI computation hardware, there are specific limits on what can be exported to China, including limits on performance. Sharif needs to engage the appropriate experts to determine what can and cannot be exported. AI hardware is legal in China, dollar values are not typically the limiting factor for hardware import/export restrictions, and ethics are not a regulatory issue. 5 . B. The most realistic but also most disruptive option for disaster recovery plan testing is a full interruption. The least obtrusive but also least similar to real-world scenarios is a read-through. After that, walk-throughs and simulations are each closer to a true scenario, but parallel operations are often the most popular option because it can be done without disrupting the organization and still reasonably test capabilities. 6 . C. Cold sites are facilities large enough to use for recovery operations with appropriate power and environmental capabilities but without any additional readiness work done for computing, connectivity, or other needs. Warm sites have equipment and connectivity in place but are not actively handling live data. Hot sites have live data and could take over operations immediately. Frozen site is not a term used to describe a failover or recovery site. 7 . B. The data owner is normally responsible for classifying information at an appropriate level. This role is typically filled by a senior manager or director, who then delegates operational responsibility to a data custodian. Data creators do just that—create data—although data creators is not a commonly used role name in data role lists. CISOs are chief information security officers and are typically the top-level individual responsible for security in organizations. 8 . A. Off-site backups are the best option for disaster recovery in a scenario where a disaster directly impacts the data center. None of the other scenarios as described will directly address the issue, although snapshots to a remote storage location can act as a form of off-site backup. 9 . C. While all of the listed controls would improve authentication security, most simply strengthen the use of knowledge-based authentication. The best way to improve the authentication process would be to add a factor that is not based on knowledge through the use of multifactor authentication. This may include the use of biometric controls or token-based authentication. 10 . C. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a converged protocol that allows virtualization concepts and practices to be applied to networks. MPLS handles a wide range of protocols like asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), digital subscriber line (DSL), and others, but isn't intended to provide the centralization capabilities that SDN does. A content distribution network (CDN) is not a converged protocol, and FCoE is Fibre Channel over Ethernet, a converged protocol for storage. 11 . C. The best way to ensure that data on DVDs is fully gone is to destroy them, and pulverizing DVDs is an appropriate means of destruction. DVD-ROMs are write-only media, meaning that secure erase and zero wipes won't work. Degaussing works only on magnetic media and cannot guarantee that there will be zero data 175/220 remanence. 12 . C. Backout plans are required in some change management processes to ensure that the thought process and procedures for what to do if something does not go as planned are needed. Validating backout plan quality can be just as important as the change, and you may find, in many organizations, if nobody is watching, that backout plans may read, “Undo the change we made.” Rejecting the change won't fix the problem if the change has been made. A change review is useful to identify problems before the change is made. Failover plans are not a term commonly used in change management processes. 13 . A. All packets leaving Angie's network should have a source address from her public IP address block. Packets with a destination address from Angie's network should not be leaving the network. Packets with source addresses from other networks are likely spoofed and should be blocked by egress filters. Packets with private IP addresses as sources or destinations should never be routed onto the Internet. 14 . B. Virtual private clouds (VPCs) run on cloud-hosted infrastructure providing a secure, isolated pool of resources to be used by organizations to meet their needs. A VLAN is a virtual local area network. While VLANs are part of how most VPCs work, they alone aren't sufficient to create a VPC. An SDN, or software defined network, is used to manage networks through code, and CDNs are content delivery networks used to provide access to content around the globe that helps offload traffic while protecting against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and other issues. 15 . A. While developers may feel like they have a business need to be able to move code into production, the principle of separation of duties dictates that they should not have the ability to both write code and place it on a production server. The deployment of code is often performed by change management staff. Two-person control requires two individuals to perform an action to ensure appropriate oversight. Least privilege is the concept of only providing privileges required to perform a role, and job rotation moves individuals through job roles to ensure that different people perform tasks preventing an individual from exploiting their job function over time. 16 . A. Applying a digital signature to a message allows the sender to achieve the goal of nonrepudiation. This allows the recipient of a message to prove to a third party that the message came from the purported sender. Symmetric encryption does not support nonrepudiation. Firewalls and IDS are network security tools that are not used to provide nonrepudiation. 17 . A. System A should send an ACK to end the three-way handshake. The TCP three-way handshake is SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK. FIN is used to end a TCP connection, while RST resets the connection. 18 . B. TACACS+ is the most modern version of TACACS, the Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System. It is a Cisco proprietary protocol with added features beyond what RADIUS provides, meaning it is commonly used on Cisco networks. XTACACS is an earlier version, Kerberos is a network authentication protocol rather than a remote user authentication protocol, and RADIUS+ is a made-up term. 19 . C. Call managers and VoIP phones can be thought of as servers or appliances and embedded or network devices. That means that the most likely threats that they will face are denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and attacks against the host operating system. Malware and Trojans are less likely to be effective against a server or embedded system that doesn't browse the Internet or exchange data files; buffer overflows are usually aimed at specific applications or services. 20 . C. The blacklist approach to application control blocks certain prohibited packages but allows the installation of other software on systems. The whitelist approach uses the reverse philosophy and allows only approved software. It is worth noting that the terms blacklist and whitelist are increasingly deprecated and that you may encounter terms like block list or deny list and allow list as language and terminology shifts. As you prepare for the exam and your professional work, make sure to consider these equivalents. Antivirus software would only detect the installation of malicious software after the fact. Heuristic detection is a variant of antivirus software. 21 . B. The exposure factor (EF) is the percentage of the facility that risk managers expect will be damaged if a risk materializes. It is calculated by dividing the amount of damage by the asset value. In this case, that is $20 million in damage divided by the $100 million facility value, or 20%. 22 . B. The annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) is the number of times each year that risk analysts expect a risk to happen in any given year. In this case, the analysts expect floods once every 200 years, or 0.005 times per year. 23 . B. The annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). In this case, the SLE is $20 million, and the ARO is 0.005. Multiplying these numbers together gives you the ALE of $100,000. 24 . B. The most frequent target of account management reviews are highly privileged accounts, as they create the greatest risk. Random samples are the second most likely choice. Accounts that have existed for a longer period of time are more likely to have a problem due to privilege creep than recently created accounts, but neither of these choices is likely unless there is a specific organizational reason to choose them. 25 . D. The cloud service offerings in order from the case where the customer bears the least responsibility to where the customer bears the most responsibility are SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. In an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud computing model, the customer retains responsibility for managing operating system and application security, while the vendor manages security at the hypervisor level and below. In a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environment, the vendor takes on responsibility for the operating system, but the customer writes and configures any applications. In a software-as-a-service (SaaS) environment, the vendor takes on responsibility for the development and implementation of the application while the customer merely configures security settings within the application. 26 . A. Breach-and-attack simulation (BAS) tools typically leverage SaaS platforms as well as software agents and virtual machines to perform simulated attacks, which they leverage to provide detailed reports about security issues and their relative risk levels. 27 . D. Duress systems are intended to allow employees to notify security or others when they are in a dangerous situation or when they need help. Duress systems may be as simple as a push button and as complex as a code word or digital system that allows specific entries to trigger alarms while still performing a desired or deceptive but real-appearing action. 28 . C. While inode information leakage could represent a security concern, it does not pose the same immediate and direct risk as clickjacking, XSS vulnerabilities, or even the contextual importance of knowing the server's operating system. Clickjacking and cross-site scripting are both important issues, and knowing that the server is a Linux server is also important. 176/220 29 . D. The hearsay rule says that a witness cannot testify about what someone else told them, except under very specific exceptions. The courts have applied the hearsay rule to include the concept that attorneys may not introduce logs into evidence unless they are authenticated by the system administrator. In this scenario, George might also be able to provide a sworn affidavit, but the question doesn't include that option. The best evidence rule states that copies of documents may not be submitted into evidence if the originals are available. The parol evidence rule states that if two parties enter into a written agreement, that written document is assumed to contain all of the terms of the agreement. Testimonial evidence is a type of evidence, not a rule of evidence. 30 . B. Key risk indicators (KRIs) are valuable for organizational risk planning and understanding risk perceptions but are not designed for real-time security incident response. Tools like intrusion prevention systems (IPSs), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and others are better equipped for immediate threat detection and response. 31 . B. Worms have built-in propagation mechanisms that do not require user interaction, such as scanning for systems containing known vulnerabilities and then exploiting those vulnerabilities to gain access. Viruses and Trojan horses typically require user interaction to spread. Logic bombs do not spread from system to system but lie in wait until certain conditions are met, triggering the delivery of their payload. 32 . A. As simple as the answer may seem, labeling media or even color coding it with sensitivity levels and ensuring staff are appropriately trained on what the levels mean will normally have the biggest impact. Encrypting media can help, but without the labels, files may be stored on inappropriate media. A clear desk policy can help if casual media theft is an issue but is not likely to be an important control in this scenario. Dual control is used to ensure that a task cannot be performed by a single staff member to avoid malfeasance and is not directly useful here. 33 . B. MITRE's ATT&CK framework is broadly adopted by threat modeling and threat intelligence organizations and is used as a default model in many software packages and tools. The Diamond Model specifically addresses how to think about intrusions but does not address broader threats, and the other answers were made up for this question. 34 . A. The Agile approach to software development states that working software is the primary measure of progress, that simplicity is essential, and that businesspeople and developers must work together daily. It also states that the most efficient method of conveying information is face to face, not electronic. 35 . C. Integrity verification software would protect against this attack by identifying unexpected changes in protected data. Encryption, access controls, and firewalls would not be effective in this example because the accountants have legitimate access to the data. 36 . C. CAPEC, or Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification, is a dictionary of known attack patterns. STIX is the Structured Threat Information eXpression language used to describe threats in a standardized way, and TAXII, the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information, defines how threat information can be shared and exchanged. All of these are examples of threat intelligence feed standards. 37 . B. Sole sourcing, or relying on a single vendor, can create additional fragility in supply chains due to reliance on a single supplier. Contractual controls including requirements for supplier insurance and liability limitations, having multiple suppliers, and validating their financial stability are all common ways to help reduce supply chain risk. 38 . B. SOC 2 reports are released under NDA to select partners or customers and can provide details on the controls and any issues they may have. A SOC 1 report would provide only financial control information, and a"
SOC 3,"report provides less information since it is publicly available. 39 . C. An SOC 2, Type 2 report includes information about a data center's security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy, and includes an auditor's opinion on the operational effectiveness of the controls. SOC 3 does not have types, and a SOC 2 Type 1 is only conducted at a point in time. 40 . B. Susan asked for a security controls report (SOC 2) and received a financial internal controls report (SOC 1). This question doesn't specify whether a Type 1 or Type 2 report is desired, but most security practitioners will prefer a Type 2 report if they can get it since it tests the actual controls and their implementation instead of their descriptions. 41 . C. External auditors can provide an unbiased and impartial view of an organization's controls to third parties. Internal auditors are useful when reporting to senior management of the organization but are typically not asked to report to third parties. Penetration tests test technical controls but are not as well suited to testing many administrative controls. The employees who build and maintain controls are more likely to bring a bias to the testing of those controls and should not be asked to report on them to third parties. 42 . C. Bell–LaPadula uses security labels on objects and clearances for subjects and is therefore a MAC model. It does not use discretionary, rule-based, role-based, or attribute-based access control. 43 . D. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of students in any educational institution that accepts any form of federal funding. HIPAA is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and protects sensitive patient data in the hands of insurance and medical providers. The HITECH focuses on electronic health records and data security for healthcare data. COPPA is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 44 . D. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates the protection of protected health information (PHI). The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing (SAFE) Act deals with mortgages, the Graham–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) covers financial institutions, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) deals with student data. 45 . D. Sandboxing tools allow defenders to execute potentially malicious software in an isolated environment that provides instrumentation to capture all actions and changes performed when it is run. SIEM, or security information and event management, tools and SOAR, or security orchestration, automation, and response, tools are used to monitor environments and to respond to incidents but do not provide the ability to test and observe malicious software. SAST, or Static Application Security Testing, tools analyze source code to identify security issues. 46 . D. Implementations of syslog vary, but most provide a setting for severity level, allowing the configuration of a value that determines what messages are sent. Typical severity levels include debug, informational, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, and emergency. The facility code is also supported by syslog but is associated with which services are being logged. Security level and log priority are not typical syslog settings. 47 . D. RAID 5 is commonly used because it balances resilience and efficiency of storage space used by relying on distributed parity. RAID 0 uses two disks as a single volume, allowing for an increase in speed but a decrease in 177/220 reliability. In RAID 1, also known as disk mirroring, systems contain two physical disks. Each disk contains copies of the same data, and either one may be used in the event the other disk fails RAID 3 is rarely used and uses byte-level striping and a dedicated parity disk. 48 . A. Most vendors use the term end of life , or EOL, to denote when the product will stop being sold. End of support typically comes sometime after end of life, and this problem does not specify when end of support (EOS) will occur. Devices will still function after end of life and likely after end of support, but security professionals should raise concerns about the security of devices or software after the end of support because patches and updates will likely no longer be available. 49 . C. Interviews, surveys, and audits are all useful for assessing awareness. Code quality is best judged by code review, service vulnerabilities are tested using vulnerability scanners and related tools, and the attack surface of an organization requires both technical and administrative review. 50 . B. Unconstrained API calls can lead to denial-of-service conditions, one of the top 10 API security risks identified by OWASP in 2023. Attributing actions to an account requires proper authentication and logging, which are not tied to resource over-consumption. Malicious file access is typically due to improperly configured security, and request forgery attacks typically occur when user-supplied URIs are not validated. 51 . C. Tokens are hardware devices (something you have) that generate a one-time password (OTP) based on time or an algorithm. They are typically combined with another factor like a password to authenticate users. CAC and PIV cards are U.S. government–issued smartcards. 52 . B. A nondisclosure agreement (NDA) is a legal agreement between two parties that specifies what data they will not disclose. NDAs are common in industries that have sensitive or trade secret information they do not want employees to take to new jobs. Encryption would only help in transit or at rest, and Fred will likely have access to the data in unencrypted form as part of his job. An AUP is an acceptable use policy, and a stop-loss order is used on the stock market. 53 . C. Civil cases typically rely on a preponderance of evidence. Criminal cases must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Real evidence is object evidence—tangible things that can be brought into a court of law. Documentary evidence are written items used to prove facts. Neither of these is an evidentiary standard; instead, they describe types of evidence. 54 . C. Binary key spaces contain a number of keys equal to 2 raised to the power of the number of bits. Two to the eighth power is 256, so an 8-bit key space contains 256 possible keys. 55 . C. Scoping is the process of reviewing and selecting security controls based on the system that they will be applied to. Editing is not a commonly used term in this context. Baselines are used as a base set of security controls, often from a third-party organization that creates them. Standardization isn't a relevant term here. 56 . B. Background checks are frequently performed to identify potential issues before hiring a new employee. They can identify a variety of concerns and are commonly used across many industries. Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) are used during and after employment to protect confidential information. Noncompetes are used to prevent employees from working in a similar industry for a given period of time after departure. COA, or certificate of authenticity, is not used in employment situations. 57 . D. Systems and media should be labeled with the highest level of sensitivity that they store or handle. In this case, based on the U.S. government classification scheme, the highest classification level in use on the system is Secret. Mixed classification provides no useful information about the level, whereas Top Secret and Confidential are too high and too low, respectively. 58 . C. She has placed compensating controls in place. Compensating controls are used when controls like the locks in this example are not sufficient. While the alarm is a physical control, the signs she posted are not. Similarly, the alarms are not administrative controls. None of these controls helps to recover from an issue, and they are thus not recovery controls. 59 . D. Insurance is a form of risk transfer. Organizations pay insurers premiums, transferring the risk to them in exchange for the payment. Insurers may mitigate their risk through the terms of the insurance policy and may also insure themselves. Acceptance simply means acknowledging the risk, avoidance would require means to prevent the risk from occurring, and mitigation attempts to reduce the impact of the risk if it occurs. 60 . D. A SOC 2 assessment looks at controls that affect security, and a Type 2 report validates the operating effectiveness of the controls. SOC 1 engagement assesses controls that might impact financial reporting, and a Type 1 report provides the auditors opinions of the descriptions of controls provided by management at a single point in time—not the actual implementations of the controls. 61 . C. The ability to inspect open-source software (OSS) means that organizations can inspect it but more importantly that others can and often have also inspected it. This results in software that has had far more review than some closed-source or commercial packages (although large organizations may perform more review). The ability to change the code can sometimes be important as well, but changing open-source code inhouse can create maintenance issues in the future. Open-source software may be compiled, but the source will still be available. The code being free is not a security advantage or disadvantage. 62 . B. Provisioning includes the creation, maintenance, and removal of user objects from applications, systems, and directories. Registration occurs when users are enrolled in a biometric system; population and authenticator loading are not common industry terms. 63 . C. Release control occurs after changes are finalized. With changes that are ready to be implemented in hand, release managers can follow their process with steps that typically include removing debugging code and conducting acceptance testing. Request control is the start of a process that allows users to submit change requests, while change control handles the process of ensuring quality assurance happens, that documentation is done, and that security testing is handled. Finally, configuration control is part of software configuration management, not the change process. 64 . C. The formula for determining the number of encryption keys required by a symmetric algorithm is ((n*(n − 1))/2). With six users, you will need ((6*5)/2), or 15 keys. 65 . B. Patents have the shortest duration of the techniques listed: at most, 20 years. Copyrights last for 70 years beyond the death of the author if owned by an individual, or 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation if owned by a corporation. Trademarks are renewable indefinitely, and trade secrets are protected as long as they remain secret. 66 . C. In a risk acceptance strategy, the organization chooses to take no action other than documenting the risk. Purchasing insurance would be an example of risk transference. Relocating the data center would be risk avoidance. Reengineering the facility is an example of a risk mitigation strategy. 178/220 67 . C. Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) provide immediate, battery-driven power for a short period of time to cover momentary losses of power. Generators are capable of providing backup power for a sustained period of time in the event of a power loss, but they take time to activate. RAID and redundant servers are highavailability controls but do not cover power loss scenarios. 68 . C. Password histories retain a list of previous passwords, preferably a list of salted hashes for previous passwords, to ensure that users don't reuse their previous passwords. Longer minimum age can help prevent users from changing their passwords and then changing them back but won't prevent a determined user from eventually getting their old password back. Length requirements and complexity requirements tend to drive users to reuse passwords if they're not paired with tools like single sign-on, password storage systems, or other tools that decrease the difficulty of password management. 69 . B. The single loss expectancy (SLE) is the amount of damage that a risk is expected to cause each time it occurs. ALE is the annual loss expectancy (probability of loss times reduction in value if a loss occurs), ARO is the annual rate of occurrence or how often in a given year the event is likely to happen, and AV is the asset value. 70 . B. Sanitization includes steps such as removing the hard drive and other local storage from PCs before they are sold as surplus. Degaussing uses magnetic fields to wipe media, purging is an intense form of clearing used to ensure that data is removed and unrecoverable from media, and removing does not necessarily imply destruction of the drive. 71 . D. During the Reporting phase, incident responders assess their obligations under laws and regulations to report the incident to government agencies and other regulators. 72 . B. The bank that Charles works at is using job rotation to ensure that employees are not exploiting the rights and permissions that they have in their roles. The practice is intended to allow the next person in the role to identify irregularities and to prevent individuals from hiding malfeasance. Dual control requires two or more staff members to complete a task to ensure that a single employee cannot abuse their role. Cross-training ensures that multiple staff members have the necessary skills for a task, reducing the impact of losing a staff member. 73 . B. Full device encryption, when combined with mandatory passcodes, offers the strongest defense against data loss from stolen devices. Encryption secures data at rest, making it unreadable without the correct decryption key, while passcodes provide an initial barrier against unauthorized access. Although application management, remote wipe, and GPS tracking are valuable for overall device security and recovery, they do not offer the same level of data protection as encryption and passcodes. Specifically, encryption ensures data security independently of the device's network connectivity or physical location. 74 . D. SMTP servers that don't authenticate users before relaying their messages are known as open relays. Open relays that are Internet-exposed are typically quickly exploited to send email for spammers. 75 . D. Sending logs to a secure log server is the most effective way to ensure that logs survive a breach. Encrypting local logs won't stop an attacker from deleting them, and requiring administrative access won't stop attackers who have breached a machine and acquired escalated privileges. Log rotation archives logs based on time or file size and can also purge logs after a threshold is hit. Rotation won't prevent an attacker from purging logs. 76 . C. A security information and event management (SIEM) tool is designed to provide automated analysis and monitoring of logs and security events. A SIEM tool that receives access to logs can help detect and alert on events such as logs being purged or other breach indicators. An IDS can help detect intrusions, but IDSs are not typically designed to handle central logs. A central logging server can receive and store logs but won't help with analysis without taking additional actions. Syslog is simply a log format. 77 . B. Requiring authentication can help provide accountability by ensuring that any action taken can be tracked back to a specific user. Storing logs centrally ensures that users can't erase the evidence of actions that they have taken. Log review can be useful when identifying issues, but digital signatures are not a typical part of a logging environment. Logging the use of administrative credentials helps for those users but won't cover all users, and encrypting the logs doesn't help with accountability. Authorization helps, but being able to specifically identify users through authentication is more important. 78 . B. Port address translation (PAT) is used to allow a network to use any IP address set inside without causing a conflict with the public Internet. PAT is often confused with network address translation (NAT), which maps one internal address to one external address. IPsec is a security protocol suite, software-defined networking (SDN) is a method of defining networks programmatically, and IPX is a non-IP network protocol. 79 . C. Each of the precautions listed helps to prevent social engineering by helping prevent exploitation of trust. Avoiding voice-only communications is particularly important, since establishing identity over the phone is difficult. The other listed attacks would not be prevented by these techniques. 80 . A. The CIS benchmarks provide a useful security standard and baseline to assess systems against or to configure them to. Organizations can adapt and modify the baseline to meet their specific needs while speeding up deployment by using an accepted industry standard. They are not a compliance standard and do not provide provisioning or automation, but tools that do may use the benchmark as a standard to do so. 81 . D. Remnant data is data that is left after attempts have been made to remove or erase it. Bitrot is a term used to describe aging media that decays over time. MBR is the master boot record, a boot sector found on hard drives and other media. Leftover data is not an industry term. 82 . C. During a parallel test, the team activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. A simulation test involves a role-play of a prepared scenario overseen by a moderator. Responses are assessed to help improve the organization's response process. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems. 83 . C. Discretionary access control gives owners the right to decide who has access to the objects they own. Rolebased access control uses administrators to make that decision for roles or groups of people with a role, taskbased access control uses lists of tasks for each user, and rule-based access control applies a set of rules to all subjects. 84 . C. Trusted paths that secure network traffic from capture and link encryption are both ways to help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Brute-force and dictionary attacks can both be prevented using back-off algorithms that slow down repeated attacks. Log analysis tools can also create dynamic firewall rules, or an IPS can block attacks like these in real time. Spoofed login screens can be difficult to prevent, although user awareness 179/220 training can help. 85 . D. The four canons of the ISC2 Code of Ethics are to protect society, the common good, the necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure; act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally; provide diligent and competent service to principals; and advance and protect the profession. 86 . A. The emergency response guidelines should include the immediate steps an organization should follow in response to an emergency situation. These include immediate response procedures, a list of individuals who should be notified of the emergency, and secondary response procedures for first responders. They do not include long-term actions such as activating business continuity protocols, ordering equipment, or activating DR sites. 87 . C. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is the best choice for providing authentication and authorization information, particularly for browser-based SSO. HTML is primarily used for web pages, SPML is used to exchange user information for SSO, and XACML is used for access control policy markup. 88 . D. Individuals with specific business continuity roles should receive training on at least an annual basis. 89 . B. Application programming interfaces (APIs), user interfaces (UIs), and physical interfaces are all tested during the software testing process. Network interfaces are not typically tested, and programmatic interfaces are another term for APIs. 90 . A. Product tampering, implants of software or hardware, and counterfeits are all common concerns for graymarket hardware. API vulnerabilities are a concern based on vendor software and may exist and require patching whether a device is purchased through an OEM or the gray market. 91 . C. Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) allows multiple routing tables to be used on the same device simultaneously. This is similar to the concept of VLANs on a layer 2 switch but operating at layer 3. Routing instances operate independently, allowing IP addresses to overlap without conflict, supporting segmentation and thus permitting flexibility for zero trust implementations and other security solutions. VRF can be used to support VPCs, but that is not its only use. It is not like a VPN, and while it can be used with multilayer protocols, that isn't a primary purpose. 92 . A. RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that requires only two keys for each user. IDEA, 3DES, and Skipjack are all symmetric encryption algorithms and would require a key for every unique pair of users in the system. 93 . D. Function-as-a-service deployments are an example of a serverless deployment running on the cloud provider's cloud environment. Serverless computing solutions like AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, and Google Cloud functions require less overhead when applications are designed from the ground up to leverage function as a service technology. ICS is an industrial control system used to manage systems and processes such as utilities or factories. VPCs are virtual private clouds where infrastructure is provisioned and used like a virtual data center, and embedded systems are built into other devices. 94 . D. The log entries contained in this example show the allow/deny status for inbound and outbound TCP and UDP sessions. This is, therefore, an example of a firewall log. 95 . D. Zero-day vulnerabilities remain in the dangerous zero-day category until the release of a patch that corrects the vulnerability. At that time, it becomes the responsibility of IT professionals to protect their systems by applying the patch. Implementation of other security controls, such as encryption or firewalls, does not change the nature of the zero-day vulnerability. 96 . C. An HTML5-based VPN will provide Elle's staff with access to the applications they need without requiring the installation of a client that might be challenging or impossible without managed machines. A client-based IPsec VPN provides additional opportunities for control that a broadly deployed base of directly accessed machines via RDP does not, making it the second-best choice here. Deploying fiber for direct connections for end users is not viable for most organizations based on cost and complexity. 97 . B. Edge computing is a technology that involves placing infrastructure closer to the point of use. This approach offers several benefits such as reduced latency, improved performance for local processing, and reduced traffic to remote data centers or the cloud. On the other hand, cloud computing is typically provided at a remote facility, is scalable and frequently multitenant. Hybrid cloud is a combination of local and remote clouds. Finally, microservices utilize loosely coupled services that communicate via lightweight protocols to accomplish specific tasks that are then combined to achieve overall goals. 98 . C. The sender of a message encrypts the message using the public key of the message recipient. 99 . D. The recipient of a message uses their own private key to decrypt messages that were encrypted with the recipient's public key. This ensures that nobody other than the intended recipient can decrypt the message. 100 . D. Digital signatures enforce nonrepudiation. They prevent individuals from denying that they were the actual originator of a message. 101 . B. An individual creates a digital signature by encrypting the message digest with their own private key. 102 . D. The comparison of a factor to validate an identity is known as authentication. Identification would occur when Jim presented his user ID. Tokenization is a process that converts a sensitive data element to a nonsensitive representation of that element. Hashing transforms a string of characters into a fixed-length value or key that represents the original string. 103 . C. The most important item in facility design is the safety of personnel. Once designs take that into account, security, operational effectiveness, and other concerns can be addressed. 104 . C. An access control vestibule (sometimes called a mantrap), which is composed of two sets of doors with an access mechanism that allows only one door to open at a time, is an example of a preventive access control because it can stop unwanted access by keeping intruders from accessing a facility due to an opened door or following legitimate staff in. It can serve as a deterrent by discouraging intruders who would be trapped in it without proper access, and of course, doors with locks are an example of a physical control. A compensating control attempts to make up for problems with an existing control or to add additional controls to improve a primary control. 105 . C. To ensure emails can be definitively attributed to their senders, Sally needs the capability of nonrepudiation. Digital signatures fulfill this need by using cryptographic techniques to bind a sender's identity to a message, making it impossible for the sender to deny having sent the email. Unlike IMAP, which is a protocol for accessing email, and DKIM, which verifies the domain origin of an email, digital signatures provide cryptographic proof of origin and integrity. Encryption, while securing the content of messages, does not inherently provide nonrepudiation. 106 . D. In most situations, employers may not access medical information due to healthcare privacy laws. Reference 180/220 checks, criminal records checks, and credit history reports are all typically found during pre-employment background checks. 107 . A. Naomi's organization operates under the concept of least privilege. Individuals only receive the rights that they need to accomplish their tasks. This also means that the organization will need to ensure that those rights do not accrue to users over time and that they are changed or removed when user roles change. Privileged account management is the process of properly managing accounts with higher levels of privilege like administrative accounts. Job rotation moves employees between roles to ensure that they do not take advantage of the role and that a new set of eyes can help identify problems. Privilege escalation is the process of gaining additional rights when attacking systems or services. 108 . A. When a data stream is converted into a segment (TCP) or a datagram (UDP), it transitions from the Session layer to the Transport layer. This change from a message sent to an encoded segment allows it to then traverse the Network layer. 109 . C. The user has successfully explained a valid “need to know” the data—completing the report requested by the CFO requires this access. However, the user has not yet demonstrated that they have appropriate clearance to access the information. A note from the CFO would meet this requirement. 110 . B. Sharif is using gamification, the process of making awareness efforts like a game to motivate users. Security champions are staff members who are selected or volunteer to advocate for and raise security awareness in their teams and divisions. Social engineering efforts leverage human behaviors, and awareness training is training intended to raise awareness of security risks, issues, and attacker techniques. 111 . D. A system inventory is most frequently used to associate individuals with systems or devices. This can help when tracking their support history and aids in provisioning the proper tools, permissions, and data to a system. Both barcode and RFID property tags are used to identify systems, which can then be checked against a system inventory. Finally, enterprise content management tools are used to manage files and data as part of workflows and other business processes. 112 . C. The create rule allows a subject to create new objects and also creates an edge from the subject to that object, granting rights to the new object. 113 . A. Metasploit provides an extensible framework, allowing penetration testers to create their own exploits in addition to those that are built into the tool. Unfortunately, penetration testing can only cover the point in time when it is conducted. When conducting a penetration test, the potential to cause a denial of service due to a fragile service always exists, but it can test processes and policies through social engineering and operational testing that validates how those processes and policies work. 114 . A. Data remanence is a concern due to the storage devices often found in multifunction photocopier/printer devices, particularly for devices used in an administrative headquarters. While compliance may be a concern, we don't know enough about Colin's organization to know if compliance concerns would require this. Asset management and asset inventory can both handle either destruction or sale for most organizations. 115 . C. X.509 defines standards for public key certificates like those used with many smartcards. X.500 is a series of standards defining directory services. The Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML) and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) aren't standards that Alex should expect to see when using a smartcard to authenticate. 116 . C. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regulates websites that cater to children or knowingly collect information from children younger than 13. 117 . A. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) applies to healthcare information and is unlikely to apply in this situation. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and Government Information Security Reform Act regulate the activities of all government agencies. The Homeland Security Act (HSA) created the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and, more importantly for this question, included the Cyber Security Enhancement Act of 2002 and the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) provides specific protections for systems operated by government agencies. 118 . C. FedRAMP is a U.S. government compliance program that standardizes how cloud services are assessed, monitored, and handle authorization. There is a FedRAMP marketplace for service providers and services that have been authorized by FedRAMP. COBIT is an IT management and governance framework, SABSA is a riskbased enterprise information security model, and PCI is a security standard created by and used by the payment card industry. 119 . C. Access control systems rely on identification and authentication to provide accountability. Effective authorization systems are desirable, but not required, since logs can provide information about who accessed what resources, even if access to those resources is not managed well. Of course, poor authorization management can create many other problems. 120 . B. Checksums validate whether a file or other data object has been changed or modified, and thus, they support integrity. 121 . C. The 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 address range is one of the ranges defined by RFC 1918 as private, nonroutable IP ranges. Scott's ISP (and any other organization with a properly configured router) will not route traffic from these addresses over the public Internet. 122 . B. Jack's organization is using a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) model where the application is updated and deployed on an ongoing basis. This can allow for an agile application but requires strong testing and validation practices to ensure that bad code doesn't make it into production. Waterfall is a development model that is based on a slower, precise process. SCM is software configuration management, and an IDE is an integrated development environment. 123 . A. A well-designed set of VLANs based on functional groupings will logically separate segments of the network, making it difficult to have data exposure issues between VLANs. Changing the subnet mask will only modify the broadcast domain and will not fix issues with packet sniffing. Gateways would be appropriate if network protocols were different on different segments. Port security is designed to limit which systems can connect to a given port. 124 . B. Any 10.x.x.x address is a private address as defined by RFC 1918. APIPA addresses are self-assigned by Windows when they cannot contact a DHCP server. 127.0.0.1 is a loopback address that systems use to connect with themselves. Public IP addresses compose the majority of IP addresses with the exception of reserved addresses like those described in RFC 1918. 125 . D. Nikto is a web application and server scanning tool and is best suited to Jim's needs. Nmap is a port scanner, Hydra is a login cracking tool, and Metasploit is a complete penetration testing framework but isn't 181/220 designed specifically to test web applications and servers. Chapter 11: Practice Test 3 1 . B. NIST SP 800-18 describes system owner responsibilities that include helping to develop system security plans, maintaining the plan, ensuring training, and identifying, implementing, and assessing security controls. A data owner is more likely to delegate these tasks to the system owner. Custodians may be asked to enforce those controls, whereas a user will be directly affected by them. 2 . C. ESP's Transport mode encrypts IP packet data but leaves the packet header unencrypted. Tunnel mode encrypts the entire packet and adds a new header to support transmission through the tunnel. 3 . B. In level 2, the Repeatable level of the SW-CMM, the organization introduces basic life cycle management processes. Reuse of code in an organized fashion begins, and repeatable results are expected from similar projects. The crucial process areas for this level include Requirements Management, Software Project Planning, Software Project Tracking and Oversight, Software Subcontract Management, Software Quality Assurance, and Software Configuration Management. Software Quality Management is a process that occurs during level 4, the Managed stage of the SW-CMM. 4 . A. Key risk indicators (KRIs) are often used to monitor risk for organizations that establish an ongoing risk management program. Using automated data gathering and tools that allow data to be digested and summarized can provide predictive information about how organizational risks are changing. KPIs are key performance indicators, which are used to assess how an organization is performing. Quantitative risk assessments are good for point-in-time views with detailed valuation and measurement-based risk assessments, whereas a penetration test would provide details of how well an organization's security controls are working. 5 . D. The three-way handshake is SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK. System B should respond with “Synchronize and Acknowledge” to System A after it receives a SYN. 6 . A. Systems that respond to pings will show the time to live for packets that reach them. Since TTL is decremented at each hop, this can help build a rough network topology map. In addition, some firewalls respond differently to pings than a normal system, which means pinging a network can sometimes reveal the presence of firewalls that would otherwise be invisible. Hostnames are revealed by a DNS lookup, and ICMP types allowed through a firewall are not revealed by only performing a ping. ICMP can be used for router advertisements, but pinging won't show them! 7 . C. Authorization defines what a subject can or can't do. Identification occurs when a subject claims an identity, accounting is provided by the logs and audit trail that track what occurs on a system, and authentication occurs when that identity is validated. 8 . C. When a system uses shadowed passwords, the hashed password value is stored in /etc/shadow instead of /etc/passwd . The /etc/passwd file would not contain the password in plaintext or hashed form. Instead, it would contain an x to indicate that the password hash is in the shadow file. The * character is normally used to disable interactive logins to an account. 9 . B. The log entries show the characteristic pattern of a port scan. The attacking system sends connection attempts to the target system against a series of commonly used ports. 10 . A. Testing for desired functionality is use-case testing. Dynamic testing is used to determine how code handles variables that change over time. Misuse testing focuses on how code handles examples of misuse, and fuzzing feeds unexpected data as an input to see how the code responds. 11 . B. Privilege creep is a common problem when employees change roles over time and their privileges and permissions are not properly modified to reflect their new roles. Least privilege issues are a design or implementation problem, and switching roles isn't typically what causes them to occur. Account creep is not a common industry term, and account termination would imply that someone has removed her account instead of switching her to new groups or new roles. 12 . C. These are examples of private IP addresses. RFC 1918 defines a set of private IP addresses for use in internal networks. These private addresses including 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 should never be routable on the public Internet. 13 . B. A cognitive password authenticates users based on a series of facts or answers to questions that they know. Preset questions for cognitive passwords typically rely on common information about a user like their mother's maiden name or the name of their pet, and that information can frequently be found on the Internet. The best cognitive password systems let users make up their own questions. 14 . B. The Linux tool dd creates a bit-by-bit copy of the target drive that is well suited to forensic use, and special forensic versions of dd exist that can provide even more forensic features. Simply copying files using a tool like xcopy does not create a forensically sound copy. DBAN is a drive wiping tool and would cause Megan to lose the data she is seeking to copy. ImageMagick is a graphics manipulation and editing program. 15 . C. The blacklist approach to application control blocks certain prohibited packages but allows the installation of other software on systems. The whitelist approach uses the reverse philosophy and allows only approved software. Antivirus software would detect the installation of malicious software only after the fact. Heuristic detection is a variant of antivirus software. 16 . C. Protected health information (PHI) is specifically defined by HIPAA to include information about an individual's medical bills. PCI could refer to the payment card industry's security standard but would apply only in relation to payment cards. PII is a broadly defined term for personally identifiable information, and personal billing data isn't a broadly used industry term. 17 . D. A social engineering attack may trick a user into revealing their password to the attacker. Other attacks that depend on guessing passwords, such as brute-force attacks, rainbow table attacks, and dictionary attacks, are unlikely to be successful in light of the organization's strong password policy. 18 . A. When someone is forced to perform an action under threat, it is known as duress. 19 . A. The term that best describes the type of cloud environment used by Kayla's company, which leverages a major IaaS provider for hosting its web services and a SaaS email system operating in multitenant environments, is a public cloud. A public cloud is where the services are delivered over the public Internet and shared across different organizations. A dedicated cloud, also known as a private cloud, is operated solely for one organization, and this is not the case for Kayla's company. A private cloud is infrastructure operated solely 182/220 for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted either internally or externally, which also does not apply here. A hybrid cloud is a composition of two or more cloud delivery models (private, community, or public) that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models, which again does not match the company's use of exclusively public cloud services. 20 . B. In this scenario, all of the files on the server will be backed up on Monday evening during the full backup. Tuesday's incremental backup will include all files changed since Monday's full backup: files 1, 2, and 5. Wednesday's incremental backup will then include all files modified since Tuesday's incremental backup: files 3 and 6. Therefore, only two files are included in Wednesday's incremental backup. 21 . A. Susan is performing passive monitoring, which uses a network tap or SPAN port to capture traffic to analyze it without impacting the network or devices that it is used to monitor. Synthetic, or active, monitoring uses recorded or generated traffic to test for performance and other issues. Signature-based technologies include IDS, IPS, and antimalware systems. 22 . A. In a man-in-the-middle attack, attackers manage to insert themselves into a connection between a user and a legitimate website, relaying traffic between the two parties while eavesdropping on the connection. Although similarly named, the meet-in-the-middle attack is a cryptographic attack that does not necessarily involve connection tampering. Fraggle is a network-based denial-of-service attack using UDP packets. Wardriving is a reconnaissance technique for discovering open or weakly secured wireless networks. 23 . C. One of the core capabilities of infrastructure as a service is providing servers on a vendor-managed virtualization platform. Web-based payroll and email systems are examples of software as a service. An application platform managed by a vendor that runs customer code is an example of platform as a service. 24 . D. The exposure factor is the percentage of the facility that risk managers expect will be damaged if a risk materializes. It is calculated by dividing the amount of damage by the asset value. In this case, that is $750,000 in damage divided by the $2 million facility value, or 37.5%. 25 . C. The annualized rate of occurrence is the number of times each year that risk analysts expect a risk to happen. In this case, the analysts expect fires will occur once every 50 years, or 0.02 times per year. 26 . A. The annualized loss expectancy is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). In this case, the SLE is $750,000, and the ARO is 0.02. Multiplying these numbers together gives you the ALE of $15,000. 27 . C. The two main methods of choosing records from a large pool for further analysis are sampling and clipping. Sampling uses statistical techniques to choose a sample that is representative of the entire pool, while clipping uses threshold values to select those records that exceed a predefined threshold because they may be of most interest to analysts. 28 . C. API keys, or application programming interface keys, are passed to services and identify the program, developer, or user. With this information, Mike can programmatically control API usage per user. Of course, if the keys are inadvertently exposed, the API keys themselves could be abused. Session IDs are typically used to identify users of an application, not an API. API firewalls and API buffers were made up for this question. 29 . A. An application programming interface (API) allows external users to directly call routines within Fran's code. They can embed API calls within scripts and other programs to automate interactions with Fran's company. A web scraper or call center might facilitate the same tasks, but they do not do so in a direct integration. Data dictionaries might provide useful information, but they also do not allow direct integration. 30 . A. A fault is a momentary loss of power. Blackouts are sustained complete losses of power. Sags and brownouts are not complete power disruptions but rather periods of low-voltage conditions. 31 . A. Lauren's team would benefit from a credential management system. Credential management systems offer features like password management, multifactor authentication to retrieve passwords, logging, audit, and password rotation capabilities. A strong password policy would only make maintenance of passwords for many systems a more difficult task if done manually. Single sign-on would help if all the systems had the same sensitivity levels, but different credentials are normally required for higher-sensitivity systems. 32 . C. Windows systems will assign themselves an APIPA address between 169.254.0.1 and 169.254.255.254 if they cannot contact a DHCP server. 33 . A. Enrollment, or registration, is the initial creation of a user account in the provisioning process. Clearance verification and background checks are sometimes part of the process that ensures that the identity of the person being enrolled matches who they claim to be. Initialization is not used to describe the provisioning process. 34 . B. Criminal forensic investigations typically have the highest standards for evidence, as they must be able to help prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Administrative investigations merely need to meet the standards of the organization and to be able to be defended in court, while civil investigations operate on a preponderance of evidence. There is not a category of forensic investigation referred to as “industry” in the CISSP exam's breakdown of forensic types. 35 . B. The Fourth Amendment states, in part, that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” The First Amendment contains protections related to freedom of speech. The Fifth Amendment ensures that no person will be required to serve as a witness against themselves. The Fifteenth Amendment protects the voting rights of citizens. 36 . A. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) makes it a crime to invade the electronic privacy of an individual. It prohibits the unauthorized monitoring of email and voicemail communications. 37 . D. The kernel lies within the central ring, Ring 0. Ring 1 contains other operating system components. Ring 2 is used for drivers and protocols. User-level programs and applications run at Ring 3. Rings 0–2 run in privileged mode, whereas Ring 3 runs in user mode. 38 . D. The hypervisor runs within the virtualization platform and serves as the moderator between virtual resources and physical resources. 39 . A. In the public cloud computing model, the vendor builds a single platform that is shared among many different customers. This is also known as the shared tenancy model. 40 . D. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems. The read-through is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a read-through, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and 183/220 suggest any necessary changes. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. 41 . C. OpenID Connect is a widely supported standard that allows a user to use a single account to log into multiple sites, and Google accounts are frequently used with OpenID Connect. 42 . D. Risk acceptance occurs when an organization determines that the costs involved in pursuing other risk management strategies are not justified and they choose not to pursue any action. 43 . A, D. Accounting departments are normally required to separate sensitive duties, such as the ability to add a new vendor and issue a check. Allowing the manager to perform both of these actions would, therefore, violate the principle of separation of duties. Also, it is quite likely that the manager does not need all of these privileges to carry out their work, violating the principle of least privilege. There is no indication that the situation does not follow job rotation assignments or that the access was not properly granted and subject to a management review. 44 . C. Decentralized access control makes sense because it allows local control over access. When network connectivity to a central control point is a problem or if rules and regulations may vary significantly from location to location, centralized control can be less desirable than decentralized control despite its challenges with consistency. Since the problem does not describe specific control needs, mandatory access control and rulebased access controls could fit the need but aren't the best answer. 45 . B. The U.S. government classifies data that could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security if disclosed, and for which the damage can be identified or described, as Secret. The U.S. government does not use Classified in its formal four levels of classification. Top Secret data could cause exceptionally grave damage, whereas Confidential data could be expected to cause damage. 46 . A. The purpose of a digital certificate is to provide the general public with an authenticated copy of the certificate subject's public key. 47 . D. The last step of the certificate creation process is the digital signature. During this step, the certificate authority signs the certificate using its own private key. 48 . C. When an individual receives a copy of a digital certificate, the person verifies the authenticity of that certificate by using the CA's public key to validate the digital signature contained on the certificate. 49 . A. Mike uses the public key that he extracted from Renee's digital certificate to encrypt the message that he would like to send to Renee. 50 . C. Wireshark is a network monitoring tool that can capture and replay communications sent over a data network, including Voice over IP (VoIP) communications. Nmap, Nessus, and Nikto are all security tools that may identify security flaws in the network, but they do not directly undermine confidentiality because they do not have the ability to capture communications. 51 . C. The ISC2 Code of Ethics applies only to information security professionals who are members of ISC2. Adherence to the code is a condition of certification, and individuals found in violation of the code may have their certifications revoked. ISC2 members who observe a breach of the code are required to report the possible violation by following the ethics complaint procedures. 52 . D. Nonrepudiation is possible only with an asymmetric encryption algorithm. RSA is an asymmetric algorithm. AES, DES, and Blowfish are all symmetric encryption algorithms that do not provide nonrepudiation. 53 . D. Modification of audit logs will allow repudiation because the data cannot be trusted, and thus actions can be provably denied. The modification of the logs is also a direct example of tampering. It might initially be tempting to answer elevation of privileges and tampering, as the attacker made changes to files that should be protected, but this is an unknown without more information. Similarly, the attacker may have accessed the files, resulting in information disclosure in addition to tampering, but again, this is not specified in the question. Finally, this did not cause a denial of service, and thus that answer can be ignored. 54 . B. Content delivery networks (CDNs) place endpoints at geographic locations around the world and then cache customer content at those endpoints. The CDN servers then handle user requests for data, greatly reducing the burden on the organization's own servers and improving load time. Load balancers would distribute the load among Carmen's own servers and would, therefore, not meet her requirements. TLS acceleration may improve load time by reducing the burden of encryption on servers, but they would not place content closer to end users. Web application firewalls would be used to protect the servers against attack, but this does not match Carmen's requirements. 55 . D. The scenario describes a mix of public cloud and private cloud services. This is an example of a hybrid cloud environment. 56 . B. Each of the attributes linked to Ben's access provides information for an attribute-based information control system. Attribute-based information controls like those described in NIST SP 800-162 can take many details about the user, actions, and objects into consideration before allowing access to occur. A role-based access control would simply consider Ben's role, whereas both administrative and system discretionary access controls are not commonly used terms to describe access controls. 57 . B, D. All of these techniques are valid components of a security awareness and training program. However, users generally find policy reviews and classroom training boring. Gamification and phishing simulations are designed to bring interactivity to the effort and make it more interesting and engaging for users. 58 . C. Certificates may only be added to a certificate revocation list by the certificate authority that created the digital certificate. 59 . D. Remote journaling transfers transaction logs to a remote site on a more frequent basis than electronic vaulting, typically hourly. Transaction logging is not a recovery technique alone; it is a process for generating the logs used in remote journaling. In an electronic vaulting approach, automated technology moves database backups from the primary database server to a remote site on a scheduled basis, typically daily. Remote mirroring maintains a live database server at the backup site and mirrors all transactions at the primary site on the server at the backup site. 60 . A, B, D. The specific data elements covered by state data breach notification laws vary from state to state, but most include Social Security numbers, drivers' license numbers, and bank account numbers when paired with a PIN. No state data breach notification laws include marital status as a covered element. 61 . B. Operational investigations are performed by internal teams to troubleshoot performance or other technical issues. They are not intended to produce evidence for use in court and, therefore, do not have the rigid 184/220 collection standards of criminal, civil, or regulatory investigations. 62 . A. Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) are designed to protect the confidentiality of an organization's data, including trade secrets during and after the person's employment. NDAs do not protect against deletion or availability issues, and noncompete agreements would be required to stop competition. 63 . C. Adding a second factor can ensure that users who might be incorrectly accepted are not given access due to a higher than desired false acceptance rate (FAR) from accessing a system. The CER is the crossover between the false acceptance and false rejection rate (FRR) and is used as a way to measure the accuracy of biometric systems. Changing the sensitivity to lower the FRR may actually increase the FAR, and replacing a biometric system can be expensive in terms of time and cost. 64 . D. Data custodians are typically responsible for the technical environment and procedures related to data management, which include the backup and recovery of systems to ensure data availability. While data owners are accountable for the data and may decide what needs to be backed up, they do not perform the actual backups. Business owners and data users are more focused on the operational and decision-making aspects of the data's business use and are generally not involved in the technical aspects of data maintenance such as system backups. 65 . D. Ron's company is a data processor in this instance, as it is receiving records from the European firm. The European firm is the data controller in this case, as they bear responsibility for the data. The individuals described in the records are the data subjects. Data owners are tasked with making decisions about data such as who receives access to it and how it is used. 66 . C. This is an example of two-person control, where two people must concur to perform a sensitive action. Separation of duties is a slightly different principle, where one individual is prevented from holding the privileges to perform two separate actions that, when combined, would result in excessive permissions. Least privilege says that an individual should have the minimum necessary set of permissions to carry out their job functions. There is no indication that least privilege is violated in this scenario. Multifactor authentication is an important security control, but the scenario does not mention whether the administrators use multifactor authentication to perform these activities. 67 . C. Salting adds random text to the password before hashing in an attempt to defeat automated password cracking attacks that use precomputed values. MD5 and SHA-1 are both common hashing algorithms, so using them does not add any security. Double-hashing would only be a minor inconvenience for an attacker and would not be as effective as the use of salting. 68 . A. Guidelines provide advice based on best practices developed throughout industry and organizations, but they are not compulsory. Compliance with guidelines is optional. 69 . A. The Bell–LaPadula model includes the simple security property, which says that no user should be able to read information above their security clearance level. It also includes the star property, which says that a subject should not be able to write data to an object below their security clearance level, and the discretionary security property, which uses access matrices to control access. The Biba integrity model says that users should not be able to read data below their security clearance level. 70 . C. Regression testing ensures proper functionality of an application or system after it has been changed. Unit testing focuses on testing each module of a program instead of against its previous functional state. White- and black-box testing both describe the amount of knowledge about a system or application, rather than a specific type or intent for testing. 71 . C. Risk transference involves shifting the impact of a potential risk from the organization incurring the risk to another organization. Insurance is a common example of risk transference. 72 . A. The four canons of the ISC2 Code of Ethics are to protect society, the common good, the necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure; act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally; provide diligent and competent service to principals; and advance and protect the profession. 73 . C. A trust that allows one forest to access another's resources without the reverse being possible is an example of a one-way trust. Since Jim doesn't want the trust path to flow as the domain tree is formed, this trust has to be nontransitive. 74 . B. Susan's team is performing static analysis, which analyzes nonrunning code. Dynamic analysis uses running code, whereas gray-box assessments are a type of assessment done without full knowledge. Fuzzing feeds unexpected inputs to a program as part of dynamic analysis. 75 . A, D. Kevin may choose to pay the ransom, and he may regain access to his data by doing so, but there is no guarantee that the attackers will deliver the decryption key after he makes payment. Additionally, the payment of the ransom may be illegal depending upon the circumstances. He cannot be sure that the attackers do not have access to his information, as the ransomware may have copied data for the attackers' use. Restoring from backup is a good method to regain access to information encrypted by ransomware. 76 . A. Remote attestation creates a hash value from the system configuration to confirm the integrity of the configuration. Binding and sealing are techniques used by the TPM to encrypt data. The random number generator (RNG) function of the TPM is used to support cryptographic operations. 77 . A, C. Situations where humidity is too high may result in the buildup of moisture and corrosion of equipment. If humidity falls too low, it may result in static electricity issues. Humidity issues generally do not contribute to fires or physical access control failures. 78 . A. Hot sites contain all of the hardware and data necessary to restore operations and may be activated very quickly. Warm sites contain the necessary hardware but not the data. Cold sites contain neither hardware nor data. Mobile sites are easily transportable, which is not mentioned in this scenario. 79 . B. Syslog uses UDP port 514. TCP-based implementations of syslog use TCP port 601 when unencrypted and use TCP port 6514 when encrypted with TLS. The other ports may look familiar because they are commonly used TCP ports: 443 is HTTPS, 515 is the LPD print service, and 445 is used for Windows SMB. 80 . B. PSH is a TCP flag used to clear the buffer, resulting in immediately sending data, and URG is the TCP urgent flag. These flags are not present in UDP headers. 81 . B. Fagan inspection is a highly formalized review and testing process that uses planning, overview, preparation, inspection, rework, and follow-up steps. Static inspection looks at code without running it, dynamic inspection uses live programs, and interface testing tests where code modules interact. 82 . D. The system is set to overwrite the logs and will replace the oldest log entries with new log entries when the file reaches 20 MB. The system is not purging archived logs because it is not archiving logs. Since there can be only 20 MB of logs, this system will not have stored too much log data, and the question does not provide 185/220 enough information to know if there will be an issue with not having the information needed. 83 . D. The image shown is from a network-connected web camera. This is likely an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet, much like the Mirai botnet that had a major impact on world Internet traffic in 2016. 84 . A. Alejandro is in the first stage of the incident response process, detection. During this stage, the intrusion detection system provides the initial alert, and Alejandro performs preliminary triaging to determine if an intrusion is actually taking place and whether the scenario fits the criteria for activating further steps of the incident response process (which include response, mitigation, reporting, recovery, remediation, and lessons learned). 85 . C. After detection of a security incident, the next step in the process is response, which should follow the organization's formal incident response procedure. The first step of this procedure is activating the appropriate teams, including the organization's computer security incident response team (CSIRT). 86 . C. The root-cause analysis examines the incident to determine what allowed it to happen and provides critical information for repairing systems so that the incident does not recur. This is a component of the remediation step of the incident response process because the root-cause analysis output is necessary to fully remediate affected systems and processes. 87 . D. When using symmetric cryptography, the sender encrypts a message using a shared secret key, and the recipient then decrypts the message with that same key. Only asymmetric cryptography uses the concept of public and private key pairs. 88 . A. Business logic errors are most likely to be missed by automated functional testing. If a complete coverage code test was conducted, runtime, input validation, and error handling issues are likely to have been discovered by automated testing. Any automated system is more likely to miss business logic errors, because humans are typically necessary to understand business logic issues. 89 . A. During the lessons learned phase, analysts close out an incident by conducting a review of the entire incident response process. This may include making recommendations for improvements to the process that will streamline the efficiency and effectiveness of future incident response efforts. 90 . B. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) prohibits attempts to circumvent copyright protection mechanisms placed on a protected work by the copyright holder. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) governs the security and privacy of protected health information. The Gramm-LeachBliley Act (GLBA) governs the security and privacy of financial information. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) restricts eavesdropping on private communications. 91 . B. Linda should choose a warm site. This approach balances cost and recovery time. Cold sites take a very long time to activate, measured in weeks or months. Hot sites activate immediately but are quite expensive. Mutual assistance agreements depend on the support of another organization. 92 . A. Purchasing insurance is a way to transfer risk to another entity. Risk avoidance actions change business processes to eliminate a risk. Risk mitigation activities reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk occurring. Risk acceptance takes no action to control the risk other than acknowledging its presence. 93 . D. Gray-box testing is a blend of crystal-box (or white-box) testing, which provides full information about a target, and black-box testing, which provides little or no knowledge about the target. 94 . A. The combination of an ID card (something you have) and a PIN (something you know) is a reasonable way to control access to a physical facility. The use of a password is not a user-friendly way to control access to a physical facility. The use of an ID card (something you have) in conjunction with an access token (something you have) does not constitute multifactor authentication because both are something you have factors. The same is true for the use of a retinal scan (something you are) and a fingerprint (something you are). 95 . A. Ethernet networks in modern organizations use a star topology, where each device is directly connected to the switch and receives only traffic intended for that device. This reduces the possibility of eavesdropping on other devices. 96 . A. Proxy servers can act to anonymize web requests by hiding their true source IP addresses and removing identifying information. Content filters restrict the websites that users may access. Malware filters search for and block malicious code. Caching servers store local copies of frequently requested content to reduce loading time. 97 . A. U.S. export control laws contain special provisions around the use of encryption technology, and Evelyn should include details about the software used by her firm in the training. These regulations do not affect content filtering controls, firewall rules, or phishing simulations. 98 . A. Skip should use Secure Copy (SCP), which is a secure file transfer method. SSH is a secure command-line and login protocol, whereas HTTP is used for unencrypted web traffic. Telnet is an unencrypted command-line and login protocol. 99 . C. The California Online Privacy Protection Act requires that commercial websites that collect personal information from users in California conspicuously post a privacy policy. The act does not require compliance with the EU GDPR, nor does it use the GDPR concepts of notice or choice, and it does not require encryption of all personal data. 100 . D. Modern recommendations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are that users should not be forced to change their passwords through the use of password expiration policies. More information on these recommendations can be found in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63B, “Digital Identity Guidelines.” 101 . A. This is an example of federation, where user credentials from one organization are accepted as proof of identity by another organization. The users are not creating new accounts, so there is no identity proofing, enrollment, or provisioning activity taking place. 102 . B. Iris scans have a longer useful life than many other types of biometric factors because they don't change throughout a person's life span (unless the eye itself is damaged). Iris scanners can be fooled in some cases by high-resolution images of an eye, and iris scanners are not significantly cheaper than other scanners. 103 . D. NIST 800-53 is the standard that describes the security controls mandatory for use on U.S. federal government systems. It provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for all U.S. federal information systems except those related to national security. PCI DSS is a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle payment cards and is not specific to government systems. ISO 27001 is an international standard on how to manage information security and is not specific to U.S. federal systems. SABSA is a framework and methodology for enterprise security architecture and service management, again not specific to the mandatory controls required by U.S. government systems. 104 . C. They need a key for every possible pair of users in the cryptosystem. The first key would allow 186/220 communication between Matthew and Richard. The second key would allow communication between Richard and Christopher. The third key would allow communication between Christopher and Matthew. 105 . D. All of these controls involve the use of encryption, but only Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides a strong, effective means for protecting data in transit. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an outdated method for protecting data in transit that should no longer be used. Full disk encryption (FDE) provides encryption for data at rest. The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) manages encryption keys for use in FDE. 106 . C. The SMTP protocol does not guarantee confidentiality between servers, making TLS or SSL between the client and server only a partial measure. Encrypting the email content can provide confidentiality; digital signatures can provide nonrepudiation. 107 . D. The single quotation mark in the input field is a telltale sign that this is a SQL injection attack. The quotation mark is used to escape outside the SQL code's input field, and the text following is used to directly manipulate the SQL command sent from the web application to the database. 108 . C. TLS provides message confidentiality and integrity, which can prevent eavesdropping. When paired with digital signatures, which provide integrity and authentication, forged assertions can also be defeated. SAML does not have a security mode and relies on TLS and digital signatures to ensure security if needed. Message hashing without a signature would help prevent modification of the message but won't necessarily provide authentication. 109 . A. The goal of the business continuity planning process is to ensure that your recovery time objectives are all less than your maximum tolerable downtimes. 110 . C. The remediation phase of incident handling focuses on conducting a root-cause analysis to identify the factors contributing to an incident and implementing new security controls, as needed. 111 . A. The S/MIME secure email format uses the P7S format for encrypted email messages. If the recipient does not have a mail reader that supports S/MIME, the message will appear with an attachment named smime.p7s . 112 . A. Aggregation is a security issue that arises when a collection of facts has a higher classification than the classification of any of those facts standing alone. An inference problem occurs when an attacker can deduce information of greater sensitivity from a lower security level fact. SQL injection is a web application exploit. Multilevel security is a system control that allows the simultaneous processing of information at different classification levels. 113 . B. Polyinstantiation allows the storage of multiple different pieces of information in a database at different classification levels to prevent attackers from conducting aggregation or inference attacks. Kim could store incorrect location information in the database at lower classification levels to prevent the aggregation attack in this scenario. Input validation, server-side validation, and parameterization are all techniques used to prevent web application attacks and are not effective against inference attacks. 114 . B. The tail number is a database field because it is stored in the database. It is also a primary key because the question states that the database uniquely identifies aircraft using this field. Any primary key is, by definition, also a candidate key. There is no information provided that the tail number is a foreign key used to reference a different database table. 115 . B. Foreign keys are used to create relationships between tables in a database. The database enforces referential integrity by ensuring that the foreign key used in a table has a corresponding record with that value as the primary key in the referenced table. 116 . B. The waterfall model uses an approach that develops software sequentially, spending quite a bit of time up front on the development and documentation of requirements and design. The spiral and Agile models focus on iterative development and are appropriate when requirements are not well understood or iterative development is preferred. DevOps is an approach to integrating development and operations activities and is not an SDLC model. 117 . A. The data owner is a senior manager who bears ultimate responsibility for data protection tasks. The data owner typically delegates this responsibility to one or more data custodians. 118 . D. Fuzz testing tools are designed to provide invalid or unexpected input to applications, testing for vulnerabilities like format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflow issues, and other problems. A static analysis relies on examining code without running the application or code and thus would not fill forms as part of a web application. Brute-force tools attempt to bypass security by trying every possible combination for passwords or other values. A white box is a type of penetration test where the testers have full knowledge of the environment. 119 . B. Warren could use a survey or third-party assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign, but the best evidence would be provided by a phishing simulation where the organization measures user responses to simulated phishing attacks. Code reviews would not be useful in evaluating the effectiveness of antiphishing campaigns. 120 . B. Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems may identify a zero-day vulnerability because it deviates from normal patterns of activity. Signature-based detection methods would not be effective because there are no signatures for zero-day vulnerabilities. Strong patch management would not be helpful because, by definition, zero-day vulnerabilities do not have patches available. Full-disk encryption would not detect an attack because it is not a detective control. 121 . A. Whether Rob has standing to report this situation to ISC2 depends upon the canon(s) violated by the activity. This behavior violates canon II, “Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.” Any member of the public may file a claim under canons I or II. Only an employer or someone with a contracting relationship with the individual may file a complaint under canon III. Anyone who is certified or licensed as a professional and subscribes to a code of ethics as part of that licensure or certification is eligible to file a canon IV complaint. 122 . A. The emergency response guidelines should include the immediate steps an organization should follow in response to an emergency situation. These include immediate response procedures, a list of individuals who should be notified of the emergency, and secondary response procedures for incident responders. They do not include long-term actions such as activating business continuity protocols, ordering equipment, or activating disaster recovery sites. 123 . D. An access control vestibule (or mantrap) uses two sets of doors, only one of which can open at a time. An access control vestibule is a type of preventive access control, although its implementation is a physical control. 124 . B. RAID level 5 is also known as disk striping with parity. It uses three or more disks, with the equivalent of one disk containing parity information used to restore data to another disk in the event of failure. When used with three disks, RAID 5 is able to withstand the loss of a single disk. 125 . The SOC levels match the report descriptions as follows: 187/220 1 . SOC 1, Type 1: D. A report that provides the auditor's opinions of financial statements about controls at the service organization and that includes a report on the opinion on the presentation of the service organization's system as well as suitability of the controls 2 . SOC 1, Type 2: C. A report that provides an assessment of the risk of material misstatement of financial statement assertions affected by the service organization's processing and that includes a description of the service auditor's tests of the controls and the results of the tests and their effectiveness 3 . SOC 2: B. A report that provides predefined, standard benchmarks for controls involving confidentiality, availability, integrity, and privacy of a system and the information it contains, generally for restricted use 4 . SOC 3: A. A general use report that reports on the effectiveness of controls related to compliance and/or operations Chapter 12: Practice Test 4 1 . C. Detective access controls operate after the fact and are intended to detect or discover unwanted access or activity. Preventive access controls are designed to prevent the activity from occurring, whereas corrective controls return an environment to its original status after an issue occurs. Directive access controls limit or direct the actions of subjects to ensure compliance with policies. 2 . C. A honeypot is a decoy computer system used to bait intruders into attacking. A honeynet is a network of multiple honeypots that creates a more sophisticated environment for intruders to explore. A pseudo-flaw is a false vulnerability in a system that may distract an attacker. Administrators often include pseudo-flaws on honeypots to emulate well-known operating system vulnerabilities. A darknet is a segment of unused network address space that should have no network activity and, therefore, may be easily used to monitor for illicit activity. 3 . C. The crossover error rate (CER) is the point where the false acceptance rate (FAR) and the false rejection rate (FRR) cross over, and it is a standard assessment used to compare the accuracy of biometric devices. 4 . A. At point B, the false acceptance rate (FAR) is quite high, whereas the false rejection rate (FRR) is relatively low. This may be acceptable in some circumstances, but in organizations where a false acceptance can cause a major problem, it is likely that they should instead choose a point to the right of point A. 5 . B. CER is a standard used to assess biometric devices. If the CER for this device does not fit the needs of the organization, Ben should assess other biometric systems to find one with a lower CER. Sensitivity is already accounted for in CER charts, and moving the CER isn't something Ben can do. FRR is not a setting in software, so Ben can't use that as an option either. 6 . B. Personally identifiable information (PII) can be used to distinguish a person's identity. Personal health information (PHI) includes data such as medical history, lab results, insurance information, and other details about a patient. Personal protected data is a made-up term, and PID is an acronym for process ID, the number associated with a running program or process. 7 . D. The figure shows the waterfall model, developed by Winston Royce. An important characteristic of this model is a series of sequential steps that include a feedback loop that allows the process to return one step prior to the current step when necessary. 8 . B. Encapsulation creates both the benefits and potential issues with multilayer protocols. Bridging can use various protocols but does not rely on encapsulation. Hashing and storage protocols typically do not rely on encapsulation as a core part of their functionality. 9 . C. OAuth is used to provide secure delegated access in scenarios exactly like this. OpenID is used to sign in using credentials from an identity provider to other services, such as when you log in with Google to other sites. SAML, or Security Assertion Markup Language, is used to make security assertions allowing authentication and authorizations between identity providers and service providers. Kerberos is mostly used inside of organizations instead of for federation, as this question focuses on. OAuth is specifically designed to provide secure delegated access, allowing Amanda's application to access users' Gmail contacts without requiring users to share their Gmail credentials. It is widely used by cloud services for this purpose. In contrast, OpenID is primarily for authenticating users with an external identity provider, SAML is used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between providers, and Kerberos is typically employed for internal network authentication, not for cloud-based or federated services as described in this scenario. 10 . B. The recovery time objective (RTO) is the amount of time that it may take to restore a service after a disaster without unacceptable impact on the business. The RTO for each service is identified during a business impact assessment. 11 . A. Each of these answers may be a concern, but the overriding security concern is whether the hardware and firmware can be trusted or may have been modified. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have business reasons to ensure the security of their products, but third parties in the supply chain may not feel the same pressure. Both availability of support and whether the hardware is legitimate are also concerns, but less immediate security concerns. Finally, hardware may be older than expected, or may be used, refurbished, or otherwise not new. 12 . C. When done properly, a sanitization process fully ensures that data does not remain on the system before it is reused. Clearing and erasing can both be failure prone, and of course, destruction wouldn't leave a machine or device available for reuse. 13 . C. In a gray-box test, the tester evaluates the software from a user perspective but has access to the source code as the test is conducted. White-box tests also have access to the source code but perform testing from a developer's perspective. Black-box tests work from a user's perspective but do not have access to source code. Blue boxes are a telephone hacking tool and not a software testing technique. Note: as language changes, new terms like zero knowledge, partial knowledge, and full knowledge are starting to replace white-, gray-, and black-box testing terms. 14 . D. The DevOps approach to technology management seeks to integrate software development, operations, and quality assurance in a cohesive effort. It specifically attempts to eliminate the issue of taking problems and “throwing them over the fence” by building collaborative relationships between members of the IT team. 15 . B. A security information and event management (SIEM) tool is designed to centralize logs from many locations in many formats and to ensure that logs are read and analyzed despite differences between different systems and devices. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used for some log messaging but is not a 188/220 solution that solves all of these problems. Most non-Windows devices, including network devices among others, are not designed to use the Windows event log format, although using NTP for time synchronization is a good idea. Finally, local logging is useful, but setting clocks individually will result in drift over time and won't solve the issue with many log sources. 16 . C. Ethical disclosure involves informing organizations of flaws and issues. Unlike bug bounties, this does not rely on organizations providing financial or other rewards. Ethical disclosure may involve timeframes to ensure that companies do not ignore issues, but a focus on collaboration and public safety is common. CVEs are created when flaws are reported to the CVE program. There is no blackmail behavior involved in this description. 17 . A. The single quotation mark in the input field is a telltale sign that this is a SQL injection attack. The quotation mark is used to escape outside the SQL code's input field, and the text that follows is used to directly manipulate the SQL command sent from the web application to the database. 18 . D. Procedures are formal, mandatory documents that provide detailed, step-by-step actions required from individuals performing a task. 19 . C. The CIS benchmarks are configuration baselines that are frequently used to assess the security settings or configuration for devices and software. Baselining is the process of configuring and validating that a system meets security configuration guidelines or standards. 20 . B. A typical incident response (IR) process will begin mitigation efforts after response has started and then will move into the recovery, reporting, and lessons learned phases. It is important to remember that while the IR cycle is drawn as a cycle, it often moves back and forth between phases as new issues or details are identified. 21 . C. Data centers should be located in the core of a building. Locating it on lower floors makes it susceptible to flooding and physical break-ins. Locating it on the top floor makes it vulnerable to wind and roof damage. 22 . A. The due care principle states that an individual should react in a situation using the same level of care that would be expected from any reasonable person. It is a very broad standard. Crime prevention through environmental design is a design concept that focuses on making environments less conducive to illicit or unwanted actions. Separation of duties splits duties to ensure that a malicious actor cannot perform actions on their own like making a purchase and approving it. Informed consent is a term used in the medical industry that requires that a person's permission is required and that they must be aware of what the consequences of their actions could be. 23 . B. Criminal investigations have high stakes with severe punishment for the offender that may include incarceration. Therefore, they use the strictest standard of evidence of all investigations: beyond a reasonable doubt. Civil investigations use a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. Regulatory investigations may use whatever standard is appropriate for the venue where the evidence will be heard. This may include the beyonda-reasonable-doubt standard, but it is not always used in regulatory investigations in the United States. Operational investigations do not use a standard of evidence. 24 . C. A cloud IaaS vendor will allow Kristen to set up infrastructure as quickly as she can deploy and pay for it. A PaaS vendor provides a platform that would require her to migrate her custom application to it, likely taking longer than a hosted data-center provider. A data-center vendor that provides rack, power, and remote hands assistance fails the test based on Kristen's desire to not have to acquire or ship hardware. 25 . B. Warm sites contain the hardware necessary to restore operations but do not have a current copy of data. 26 . C. A power spike is a momentary period of high voltage. A surge is a prolonged period of high voltage. Sags and brownouts are periods of low voltage. 27 . D. Medical insurance claims will contain protected health information, or PHI. Greg should label the drives as containing PHI and then ensure that they are handled according to his organization's handling standards for that type of data. 28 . C. While both an intrusion detection system (IDS) and an intrusion prevention system (IPS) can detect attacks, only an IPS can stop attacks. This requires the IPS to be placed inline. A connection via a network tap, span port, or other similar tool for replicating network traffic will not allow defensive actions to be taken directly by the device. 29 . B. Bollards are physical security solutions that are short and strong posts or similar solutions intended to stop vehicles from crashing through or passing an area. Bollards can be used to allow pedestrians and mobility devices to pass while stopping vehicles. Fences and walls will prevent individuals from passing through them, while stairs are challenging for most mobility devices. 30 . A. Tara first must achieve a system baseline. She does this by applying the most recent full backup to the new system. This is Sunday's full backup. Once Tara establishes this baseline, she may then proceed to apply differential backups to bring the system back to a more recent state. 31 . B. To restore the system to as current a state as possible, Tara must first apply Sunday's full backup. She may then apply the most recent differential backup, from Wednesday at noon. Differential backups include all files that have changed since the most recent full backup, so the contents of Wednesday's backup contain all of the data that would be contained in Monday and Tuesday's backups, making the Monday and Tuesday backups irrelevant for this scenario. 32 . A. In this scenario, the differential backup was made at noon, and the server failed at 3 p.m. Therefore, any data modified or created between noon and 3 p.m. on Wednesday will not be contained on any backup and will be irretrievably lost. 33 . D. By switching from differential to incremental backups, Tara's weekday backups will contain only the information changed since the previous day. Therefore, she must apply all of the available incremental backups. She would begin by restoring the Sunday full backup and then apply the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday incremental backups. 34 . D. Each incremental backup contains only the information changed since the most recent full or incremental backup. If we assume that the same amount of information changes every day, each of the incremental backups would be roughly the same size. 35 . C. A man-in-the-middle (MiTM), often referred to as a person-in-the-middle or on-path attack, allows an attacker to redirect traffic and thus read or modify it. This can be completely transparent to the end user, making it a dangerous attack if the malicious actor is successful. DNS hijacking would change a system's domain name information, and there is no direct indication of that here. Similarly, ARP spoofing is one way to conduct a MiTM attack, but that detail is not here either. SQL injection is normally done via web applications to execute commands against a database server. 189/220 36 . B. Record retention ensures that data is kept and maintained as long as it is needed and that it is purged when it is no longer necessary. Data remanence occurs when data is left behind after an attempt is made to remove it, whereas data redaction is not a technical term used to describe this effort. Finally, audit logging may be part of the records retained but doesn't describe the life cycle of data. 37 . D. The Authentication Header provides authentication, integrity, and nonrepudiation for IPsec connections. The Encapsulating Security Payload provides encryption and thus provides confidentiality. It can also provide limited authentication. L2TP is an independent VPN protocol, and Encryption Security Header is a made-up term. 38 . B. The attack described in the scenario is a classic example of TCP scanning, a network reconnaissance technique that may precede other attacks. There is no evidence that the attack disrupted system availability, which would characterize a denial-of-service attack; that it was waged by a malicious insider; or that the attack resulted in the compromise of a system. 39 . C. Windows system logs include reboots, shutdowns, and service state changes. Application logs record events generated by programs, security logs track events like logins and uses of rights, and setup logs track application setup. 40 . B. Many organizations delay patches for a period of time to ensure that any previously unidentified flaws are found before the patches are installed throughout their organization. Melissa needs to balance business impact against security in her role and may choose to support this or to push for more aggressive installation practices depending on the organization's risk tolerance and security needs. 41 . A. RAID level 0 is also known as disk striping. RAID 1 is called disk mirroring. RAID 5 is called disk striping with parity. RAID 10 is known as a stripe of mirrors. 42 . A. Resource capacity agreements are used to ensure that appropriate resources will be available in a recovery scenario. Cold sites have only space and utilities and don't provide full recovery resources. Nondisclosure agreements protect information and won't ensure resource availability, and business continuity agreements are not a term used in the CISSP exam. 43 . A. Duress codes are pre-arranged codes used to indicate that the staff member is under duress. They are typically designed to be easy to communicate during normal conversation without alarming whomever may be listening in. Panic buttons are physical buttons used to summon emergency services or responders. Kidnap codes and threat codes were made up for this question. 44 . B. Fred's company needs to protect integrity, which can be accomplished by digitally signing messages. Any change will cause the signature to be invalid. Encrypting isn't necessary because the company does not want to protect confidentiality. TLS can provide in-transit protection but won't protect integrity of the messages, and of course a hash used without a way to verify that the hash wasn't changed won't ensure integrity either. 45 . A. An attribute-based access control (ABAC) system will allow Susan to specify details about subjects, objects, and access, allowing granular control. Although a rule-based access control system (RBAC) might allow this, the attribute-based access control system can be more specific and thus is more flexible. Discretionary access control (DAC) would allow object owners to make decisions, and mandatory access controls (MACs) would use classifications; neither of these capabilities was described in the requirements. 46 . B. The most effective control is to remove the drives and shred them, removing any chance for the servers to leave with data remaining on them. A trustworthy company that can provide a certificate of disposal with appropriate contractual controls may be a reasonable and cost-efficient alternative, but the company may also then want to zero wipe drives before the systems leave to reduce the risk if a system makes it out of the recycler's control. The worst answer here is reformatting, which will not remove data. 47 . B. The maximum allowed length of a Cat 6 cable is 100 meters, or 328 feet. Long distances are typically handled by a fiber run or by using network devices like switches or repeaters—not only because of the distance but also because outdoor runs can experience lightning strikes, which won't affect fiber. Knowing that copper twisted pair has distance limitations can be important in many network designs and influences where switches and other devices are placed. 48 . B. One of the main functions of a forensic drive controller is to prevent any command sent to a device from modifying data stored on the device. For this reason, forensic drive controllers are also often referred to as write blockers. 49 . A. Setting the Secure cookie will allow cookies to be sent only via HTTPS TLS or SSL sessions, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks that target cookies. The rest of the settings are problematic. For example, cookies are vulnerable to DNS spoofing. Domain cookies should usually have the narrowest possible scope, which is actually accomplished by not setting the Domain cookie. This allows only the originating server to access the cookie. Cookies without the Expires or Max-age attributes are ephemeral and will only be kept for the session, making them less vulnerable than stored cookies. Normally, the HTTPOnly attribute is a good idea, but it prevents scripting rather than requiring unencrypted HTTP sessions. 50 . B. Data remanence describes data that is still on media after an attempt has been made to remove it. Destroying the drive is a way to ensure that no data is recoverable. Data permanence describes how long data lasts and is not used in the context of data remaining on devices. 51 . B. Mandatory access control (MAC) applies labels to subjects and objects and allows subjects to access objects when their labels match. Discretionary access control (DAC) is controlled by the owner of objects, rulebased access control (sometimes called Rule-BAC) applies rules throughout a system, and role-based access control (sometimes called Role-BAC) bases rights on roles, which are often handled as groups of users. 52 . B. Identity as a service (IDaaS) provides capabilities such as account provisioning, management, authentication, authorization, reporting, and monitoring. Platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and software as a service (SaaS) are cloud service models but do not provide the identity and access management functions described in the question. 53 . C. Eavesdropping, denial-of-service attacks, and caller ID spoofing are all common VoIP attacks. Cross-site scripting targets web applications, not VoIP systems. 54 . D. This broad access may indirectly violate all of the listed security principles, but it is most directly a violation of least privilege because it grants users privileges that they do not need for their job functions. 55 . C. The Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is specifically designed for encrypted file transfer. SSH is used for secure command-line access, whereas TCP is one of the bundles of Internet protocols commonly used to transmit data across a network. IPsec could be used to create a tunnel to transfer the data but is not specifically designed for file transfer. 56 . A. OWASP recommends four critical best practices for libraries and frameworks: using libraries and frameworks 190/220 from trusted sources that are broadly used and well maintained, maintaining an inventory of third-party libraries, updating libraries and components proactively, and reducing attack surface by limiting what functions can be used. Building your own frameworks and libraries is more likely to result in vulnerabilities for most organizations than using well-maintained and supported existing options. 57 . C. The client sends its existing valid TGT to the KDC and requests access to the resource. 58 . A. The KDC must verify that the TGT is valid and whether the user has the right privileges to access the service it is requesting access to. If it does, it generates a service ticket and sends it to the client (step B). 59 . C. When a client connects to a service server (SS), it sends the following two messages: The client-to-server ticket, encrypted using the service's secret key A new authenticator, including the client ID and timestamp that is encrypted using the client-server session key The server or service that is being accessed receives all of the data it needs in the service ticket. To do so, the client uses a client-to-server ticket received from the ticket granting service. 60 . B. The service ticket in Kerberos authentication provides proof that a subject is authorized to access an object. Ticket granting services are provided by the TGS. Proof that a subject has authenticated and can request tickets to other objects and uses ticket-granting tickets, and authentication host is a made-up term. 61 . C. The first step in a business impact analysis is to identify the business's priorities. Judy should ensure that business areas are all represented and that the functions of each department or area are assessed. Once that is done, she can move on to identifying risks, evaluating likelihood and impact, and then prioritizing the resources available to the business to address the identified priorities. 62 . A. Organizations are most often concerned about hotspots creating an unsecured network connection into their secure network via laptops or other devices that are connected to them. Bridging a cellular connection to a network connection to the business's network creates a path that bypasses security controls. Hotspots could be used as rogue access points, but this is a less common scenario. They do not specifically allow wireless data to be intercepted and, in most modern implementations, are encrypted, thus limiting the likelihood of sniffing providing useful data. 63 . A. Dry pipe, deluge, and preaction systems all use pipes that remain empty until the system detects signs of a fire. Wet pipe systems use pipes filled with water that may damage equipment if there is damage to a pipe. 64 . A. Protected health information (PHI) is defined by HIPAA to include health information used by healthcare providers, such as medical treatment, history, and billing. Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can be used to identify an individual, which may be included in the PHI but isn't specifically this type of data. Protected health insurance and individual protected data are both made-up terms. 65 . B. Manual testing uses human understanding of business logic to assess program flow and responses. Mutation or generational fuzzing will help determine how the program responds to expected inputs but does not test the business logic. Interface testing ensures that data exchange between modules works properly but does not focus on the logic of the program or application. 66 . A. A Type 1 authentication factor is something you know. A Type 2 authentication factor is something you have, like a smartcard or hardware token. A Type 3 authentication factor is something you are, like a biometric identifier. There is no such thing as a Type 4 authentication factor. 67 . B. System owners develop and maintain system security plans with system administrators, and they have to ensure that appropriate security controls are in place on those systems. System owners also share responsibility for data protection with data owners. System administrators grant appropriate access and apply the controls, whereas data owners own the classification process. 68 . A. Jack is performing misuse case analysis, a process that tests code based on how it would perform if it were misused instead of used properly. Use-case testing tests valid use cases, whereas static code analysis involves reviewing the code itself for flaws rather than testing the live software. Hacker use case testing isn't an industry term for a type of testing. 69 . A, B, C, D. All of these options are useful to help prevent SQL injection. Stored procedures limit what can be done via the database server, and escaping user input makes dangerous characters less likely to be a problem. Parameterized queries limit what can be sent in a query, and input validation adds another layer of protection by limiting what can be successfully input by a user. 70 . C. Both TCP and UDP port numbers are a 16-digit binary number, which means there can be 2 16 ports, or 65,536 ports, numbered from 0 to 65,535. 71 . A. MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits (CVE) dictionary and NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD) both provide information about vulnerabilities. 72 . D. Record retention policies are used to establish what data organizations retain and how long they will retain it for. Keeping data longer than necessary can increase risk to the organization, but having data when needed for investigations, legal compliance, or other business purposes is also important. EOL, or end of life, and EOS, or end of support, apply to hardware or software and not to data. Data classification policies are used to help classify data, which may influence how long it is retained, but classification policies themselves typically do not set retention timeframes. 73 . B. Software-defined security (SDS) is an increasingly common approach to security that involves using software solutions and policies to secure environments, rather than traditional hardware-based approaches. This strategy allows for flexible and dynamic security configurations, particularly suited to the cloud's scalable nature. While a root of trust provides a foundational security element in cryptographic systems, policy engines contribute to decision-making in SDS and other frameworks by enforcing security policies. Software-defined networks focus on network management through software, showcasing the broader move toward softwaredefined approaches in IT infrastructure. 74 . A. Antenna placement, antenna design, and power levels are the three important factors in determining where a signal can be accessed and how usable it is. A captive portal can be used to control user logins, and antenna design is part of antenna types. The FCC does provide maximum broadcast power guidelines but does not require a minimum power level. 75 . C. Physically destroying the drive is the best way to ensure that there is no remnant data on the drive. SSDs are flash media, which means that you can't degauss them, whereas both random pattern writes and the built-in erase commands have been shown to be problematic due to the wear leveling built into SSDs as well as 191/220 differences in how they handle erase commands. 76 . A. Confidentiality ensures that data cannot be read by unauthorized individuals while stored or in transit. 77 . D. OWASP's secure coding practices checklist provides a wide variety of input validation recommendations, including conducting data validation on trusted systems, validating data length, range, and types, and validating all client-provided data before it is processed. Converting all data to the same data type isn't possible because multiple data types are needed for most programs and applications. 78 . C. PCI-DSS, or the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, is the industry standard Gary's company will need to comply with. ISO27001 and 27002 are information security management standards. FIPS 140 is a standard for cryptographic modules. 79 . B. A post-admission philosophy allows or denies access based on user activity after connection based on a predefined authorization matrix. Since this doesn't check the status of a machine before it connects, it can't prevent the exploit of the system immediately after connection. This doesn't preclude out-of-band or in-band monitoring, but it does mean that a strictly post-admission policy won't handle system checks before the systems are admitted to the network. 80 . B. The implicit deny principle states that any action that is not explicitly allowed is denied. This is an important concept for firewall rules and other access control systems. Implementing least privilege ensures that subjects have only the rights they need to accomplish their job. While explicit deny and final rule fall-through may sound like important access control concepts, neither is. 81 . B. Risks are the combination of a threat and a vulnerability. Threats are the external forces seeking to undermine security, such as the hacker in this case. Vulnerabilities are the internal weaknesses that might allow a threat to succeed. In this case, web defacement is the risk. In this scenario, if the hacker attempts a SQL injection attack (threat) against the unpatched server (vulnerability), the result is website defacement (risk). 82 . D. The mean time to detect a compromise is a security KPI, or key performance indicator. KPIs are used to determine how effective practices, procedures, and staff are. 83 . C. Val is conducting dynamic application security testing, or DAST. DAST simulates an attacker's actions against software to test it. SAST reviews source code to identify vulnerabilities. FAST and LAST are not software testing methodologies or tools. 84 . D. Fiber-optic cable is more expensive and can be harder to install than stranded copper cable or coaxial cable in some cases, but it isn't susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). That makes it a great solution for Jen's problem, especially if she is deploying EMI-hardened systems to go with her EMI-resistant network cables. 85 . D. The request control process provides an organized framework within which users can request modifications, managers can conduct cost/benefit analyses, and developers can prioritize tasks. 86 . B. Change control provides an organized framework within which multiple developers can create and test solutions prior to rolling them out into a production environment. 87 . C. Release control includes acceptance testing to ensure that any alterations to end-user work tasks are understood and functional. 88 . A. Configuration control ensures that changes to software versions are made in accordance with the change control and configuration management process. Updates can be made only from authorized distributions in accordance with those policies. 89 . D. Coverage analysis is performed to ensure that functionality, requirements, or other elements are completely tested. No misuse cases are described in the question, no interfaces are described, and breach attack simulations are intended to act like an attacker, rather than test for all functions. 90 . B. Risk transference involves actions that shift risk from one party to another. Purchasing insurance is an example of risk transference because it moves risk from the insured to the insurance company. 91 . C. The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) eliminates the latency inherent in the use of certificate revocation lists by providing a means for real-time certificate verification. 92 . B. A cloud access security broker (CASB) is a tool that sits between on-premises and cloud systems, monitoring traffic and enforcing security policies. This scenario exactly matches what a CASB is designed to do. The other answers were made up; none of these is an actual cloud security device or tool (at least as of the writing of this book!). 93 . B. TCP's use of a handshake process to establish communications makes it a connection-oriented protocol. TCP does not monitor for dropped connections, nor does the fact that it works via network connections make it connection-oriented. 94 . A. Gamification uses common components from games like points, scores, and competition to engage participants in a security awareness program. None of the other answers uses these together unless they use a gamification component. 95 . C. The two most important elements of a qualitative risk assessment are determining the probability and impact of each risk upon the organization. Likelihood is another word for probability. Cost should be taken into account but is only one element of impact, which also includes reputational damage, operational disruption, and other ill effects. 96 . B. When a message reaches the Data Link layer, it is called a frame. Data streams exist at the Application, Presentation, and Session layers, whereas segments and datagrams exist at the Transport layer (for TCP and UDP, respectively). 97 . A. If the ISC2 peer review board finds that a certified individual has violated the ISC2 Code of Ethics, the board may revoke their certification. The board is not able to terminate an individual's employment or assess financial penalties. 98 . D. SDLC approaches include steps to provide operational training for support staff as well as end-user training. The SDLC may use one of many development models, including the waterfall and spiral models. The SDLC does not mandate the use of an iterative or sequential approach; it allows for either approach. 99 . A. The Bell–LaPadula model includes the Simple Security Property, which prevents an individual from reading information that is classified at a level higher than the individual's security clearance. 100 . A. Identity proofing is the process of validating that the entity or individual claiming an identity is the actual person or organization that they claim to be. This commonly relies on additional information like documents or knowledge that others would not have. Registration is the process of creating an account. FIM is federated identity management, and SSO allows a single sign-on to be used across multiple systems or services. 101 . D. The files on the drive are at their most secure when the system is off and the drive is encrypted and not in a readable state. BitLocker decrypts files as needed when in use, meaning that any time after the system is 192/220 booted files may be accessed, particularly if the user is logged in and access to the system can be gained or if malware is running. 102 . C. An IPsec VPN will allow Andrea to keep her networks running as layer 2 flattened networks when necessary while providing the security for her traffic that she wants. TLS operates at a higher network layer, although traffic could be tunneled through it. BGP is a routing protocol, and AES is an encryption algorithm. 103 . A. Cellular networks have the same issues that any public network does. Encryption requirements should match those that the organization selects for other public networks like hotels, conference Wi-Fi, and similar scenarios. Encrypting all data is difficult and adds overhead, so it should not be the default answer unless the company specifically requires it. WAP is a dated wireless application protocol and is not in broad use; requiring it would be difficult. WAP does provide TLS, which would help when in use. 104 . D. Fred's best option is to use an encrypted, trusted VPN service to tunnel all of his data usage. Trusted Wi-Fi networks are unlikely to exist at a hacker conference, normal usage is dangerous due to the proliferation of technology that allows fake towers to be set up, and discontinuing all usage won't support Fred's business needs. 105 . B. Remote wipe tools are a useful solution, but they work only if the phone can access either a cellular or Wi-Fi network. Remote wipe solutions are designed to wipe data from the phone regardless of whether it is in use or has a passcode. Providers unlock phones for use on other cellular networks rather than for wiping or other feature support. 106 . C. The goal of business continuity planning exercises is to reduce the amount of time required to restore operations. This is done by minimizing the recovery time objective (RTO). 107 . C. The COBIT, or Control Objectives for Information and related Technologies, framework describes common requirements that organizations should have in place for their information systems. It is the only audit or compliance framework on the list. ITSM is the acronym for Information Technology Service Management; CIS is the Center for Information Security, which provides guidelines for system security that can be used to assess systems but is not itself an audit framework; and ATT&CK is a framework for describing threats and attack methodologies. 108 . B. The disaster recovery test types, listed in order of their potential impact on the business from the least impactful to the most impactful, are as follows: 1 . Checklist review 2 . Tabletop exercise 3 . Parallel test 4 . Full interruption test Checklist reviews are the least impactful type of exercise because they do not even require a meeting. Each team member reviews the checklist on their own. Tabletop exercises are slightly more impactful because they require bringing together the DR team in the same room. Parallel tests require the activation of alternate processing sites and require significant resources. Full interruption tests are the most impactful type of exercise because they involve shifting operations to the alternate site and could disrupt production activity. 109 . C. Redundancy is part of many availability designs. Dual power supplies allow multiple levels of availability support; they allow you to connect servers to distinct power infrastructures and also provide the ability to run if a single power supply dies. Some servers are even set up to use more than two power supplies. Another approach to this type of availability is to use more systems, rather than more expensive systems with greater support for availability. 110 . C. The CISSP CBK uses a six-stage process: Detection, Response, Mitigation, Reporting, Recovery, and Remediation. This diagram is missing Recovery. Other standards differ, using different terms or slightly different processes. 111 . B. This is an example of peering. Peering can be either public peering, a connection through an Internet Exchange Point via a network connection, or private peering done directly with another entity in a colocation facility. Ingress is traffic coming into a network, egress is traffic that is leaving a network, and east/west refers to network traffic in the same zone or layer of a network. 112 . A. A service level agreement, or SLA, contains details about how the service will be provided, what level of outages or downtime is acceptable, and what remedies may exist in the case of outages or other issues. Megan should ensure that the SLA contains both appropriate performance guarantees and penalties that will be of sufficient magnitude to compensate her company for issues while motivating the service provider to maintain a reliable service. An RPA is robotic process automation, an automation technology. An NDA is a nondisclosure agreement, a legal document used to help control the risk of information or data being exposed or shared. An MOU is a memorandum of understanding and is used when two organizations want to work together to document a shared vision or the goals they share. 113 . C. Media storage facilities are frequently used when organizations want to securely store backups like tapes in a secure, temperature-controlled facility. Cloud services are not used for physical backup media; hot sites are used to restore operations, not to store backup media; and BaaS is backup as a service—another description for a cloud backup service. 114 . A. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems. 115 . D. Ed's best option is to install an IPv6 to IPv4 gateway that can translate traffic between the networks. A bridge would be appropriate for different types of networks, whereas a router would make sense if the networks were similar. A modern switch might be able to carry both types of traffic but wouldn't be much help translating between the two protocols. 116 . D. Henry's biggest concern should be the long-term security and supportability of the IoT devices. As these devices are increasingly embedded in buildings and infrastructure, the support model and security model are important to understand. Both the lack of separate administrative access and the lack of strong encryption can 193/220 be addressed by placing the IoT devices on a dedicated subnet or network that prevents other users from accessing the devices directly. This will help limit the risk without undue expense or complexity and is a common practice. Finally, lack of storage space can be a concern but is not the most important when looking at the risks IoT devices can create. 117 . C. UDP, the User Datagram Protocol, is a connectionless, best-effort protocol that is often used when sending data quickly without strong requirements for reliability features like error correction and detection or flow control to make sense. TCP is connection-oriented and provides those and other reliability features. ICMP, the Internet Control Message Protocol, is used to check routes and paths as well as availability but is not used for significant data transfer in normal cases. SNMP is a network management monitoring protocol. 118 . B. The EU General Data Protection Regulation does not require that organizations provide individuals with employee lists. 119 . B. Tammy should choose a warm site. This type of facility meets her requirements for a good balance between cost and recovery time. It is less expensive than a hot site but facilitates faster recovery than a cold site. A red site is not a type of disaster recovery facility. 120 . B. When data reaches the Transport layer, it is sent as segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP). Above the Transport layer, data becomes a data stream, while below the Transport layer, they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link layer, and bits at the Physical layer. 121 . D. The Advanced Encryption Standard supports encryption with 128-bit keys, 192-bit keys, and 256-bit keys. 122 . D. An application programming interface (API) allows developers to create a direct method for other users to interact with their systems through an abstraction that does not require knowledge of the implementation details. Access to object models, source code, and data dictionaries also indirectly facilitates interaction but does so in a manner that provides other developers with implementation details. 123 . B. Ian's best bet is a SOC report, and a SOC 2 Type II report will assess security controls and their application over time, telling him if the organization is responsibly maintaining their security efforts. A SOC 1 report looks at financial controls, and a Type I report only looks at how controls are described, not their application over time. Ian is unlikely to be allowed to run a vulnerability scan against a major provider's infrastructure either internally or externally. 124 . D. Pass-the-hash attacks (PtH) often rely on dumped local account databases (the SAM), capturing credentials from the network while they are in transit or from active memory. Pass-the-hash attacks are not typically conducted by downloading hashes from third-party sites. 125 . The protocols match with the descriptions as follows: 1 . TCP: C. Transports data over a network in a connection-oriented fashion 2 . UDP: D. Transports data over a network in a connectionless fashion 3 . DNS: B. Performs translations between FQDNs and IP addresses 4 . ARP: A. Performs translations between MAC addresses and IP addresses The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-friendly fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) into IP addresses, making it possible to easily remember websites and hostnames. ARP is used to resolve IP addresses into MAC addresses. TCP and UDP are used to control the network traffic that travels between systems. TCP does so in a connection-oriented fashion using the three-way handshake, while UDP uses connectionless “best-effort” delivery. 194/220 IndexA AAA model, 102 , 115 , 200 , 296 , 365 , 373 , 416 ,
