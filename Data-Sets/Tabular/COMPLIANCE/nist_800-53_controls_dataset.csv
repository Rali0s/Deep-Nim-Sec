Discussion:  Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and 
integrity of audit records by moving the records from the primary system to a secondary 
or alternate system. It is a common process in systems with limited audit storage 
capacity; the audit storage is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can 
communicate with the secondary or alternate system designated for storing the audit 
records, at which point the information is transferred.

CP-2,"using a 
predefined template for the contingency plan for all organizational information systems with 
individual system owners tailoring the plan for system: -specific uses, where appropriate. The 
division of a hybrid control into its common (inheritable) and system-specific parts may vary by 
organization, depending on the types of information technologies employed, the approach used 
by the organization to manage its controls, and assignment of responsibilities. When a control is 
implemented as a hybrid control, the common control provider is responsible for ensuring the   
implementation, assessment, and monitoring of the common part of the hybrid control, and the 
system owner is responsible for ensuring the implementation, assessment, and monitoring of 
the system-specific part of the hybrid control. Implementing controls as hybrid controls can 
introduce risk if the responsibility for the implementation and ongoing management of the 
common and system-specific parts of the controls is unclear. 
The determination as to the appropriate control implementation approach (i.e., common, 
hybrid, or system-specific) is context-dependent. The control implementation approach cannot

Additionally, the control enhancement AU-3(3) (Limit Personally Identifiable Information

Due to permutations in the relationship between information security and privacy program 
objectives and risk management, there is a need for close collaboration between programs to 
select and implement the appropriate controls for information systems processing PII. 
Organizations consider how to promote and institutionalize collaboration between the two 
programs to ensure that the objectives of both disciplines are met and risks are appropriately 
managed.

2.5   TRUSTWORTHINESS AND ASSURANCE 
The trustworthiness of systems, system components, and system services is an important part 
of the risk management strategies developed by organizations.30 Trustworthiness, in this 
context, means worthy of being trusted to fulfill whatever requirements may be needed for a 
component, subsystem, system, network, application, mission, business function, enterprise, or 
other entity.31 Trustworthiness requirements can include attributes of reliability, dependability, 
performance, resilience, safety, security, privacy, and survivability under a range of potential 
adversity in the form of disruptions, hazards, threats, and privacy risks. Effective measures of 
trustworthiness are meaningful only to the extent that the requirements are complete, well-
defined, and can be accurately assessed. 
Two fundamental concepts that affect the trustworthiness of systems are functionality and 
assurance. Functionality is defined in terms of the security and privacy features, functions, 
mechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented within organizational 
systems and programs and the environments in which those systems and programs operate. 
Assurance is the measure of confidence that the system functionality is implemented correctly, 
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security 
and privacy requirements for the system—thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate 
and enforce established security and privacy policies. 
In general, the task of providing meaningful assurance that a system is likely to do what is 
expected of it can be enhanced by techniques that simplify or narrow the analysis by, for 
example, increasing the discipline applied to the system architecture, software design, 
specifications, code style, and configuration management. Security and privacy controls address 
functionality and assurance. Certain controls focus primarily on functionality while other 
controls focus primarily on assurance. Some controls can support functionality and assurance. 
 
29 Resources to support information security and privacy program collaboration are available at [SP 800-53 RES]. 
30 [SP 800-160-1] provides guidance on systems security engineering and the application of security design principles 
to achieve trustworthy systems.

AC-1,"POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Control: : 
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]: 
1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business process-level; System-
level] access control policy that: 
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and the 
associated access controls; 
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, 
documentation, and dissemination of the access control policy and procedures; and 
c. Review and update the current access control: 
1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]; and 
2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Access control policy and procedures address the controls in the AC family that are 
implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important 
factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security 
and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate 
on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program 
policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the 
need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part 
of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the 
complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy 
programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe 
how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is 
the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans 
or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control 
policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or 
changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. 
Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

Control: :   
a. Define and document the types of accounts allowed and specifically prohibited for use 
within the system; 
b. Assign account managers; 
c. Require [Assignment: organization-defined prerequisites and criteria] for group and role 
membership; 
d. Specify: 
1. Authorized users of the system; 
2. Group and role membership; and 
3. Access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and [Assignment: organization-defined attributes 
(as required)] for each account; 
e. Require approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] for requests to 
create accounts; 
f. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts in accordance with [Assignment: 
organization-defined policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria]; 
g. Monitor the use of accounts; 
h. Notify account managers and [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within: 
1. [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when accounts are no longer required; 
2. [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when users are terminated or 
transferred; and 
3. [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when system usage or need-to-know 
changes for an individual; 
i. Authorize access to the system based on: 
1. A valid access authorization; 
2. Intended system usage; and 
3. [Assignment: organization-defined attributes (as required)]; 
j. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency]; 
k. Establish and implement a process for changing shared or group account authenticators (if 
deployed) when individuals are removed from the group; and 
l. Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes. 
Discussion:  Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest, 
anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification of authorized system 
users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the 
security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional 
scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged 
access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security 
officer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to 
prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and 
guest accounts."

Discussion:  Inactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical 
action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period. 
Automatic enforcement of inactivity logout is addressed by AC-11. 
Related Controls:  AC-11. 
(6) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT 
Implement [Assignment: organization-defined dynamic privilege management 
capabilities]. 
Discussion:  In contrast to access control approaches that employ static accounts and 
predefined user privileges, dynamic access control approaches rely on runtime access 
control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management, such as attribute-based 
access control. While user identities remain relatively constant over time, user privileges 
typically change more frequently based on ongoing mission or business requirements and 
the operational needs of organizations. An example of dynamic privilege management is the 
immediate revocation of privileges from users as opposed to requiring that users terminate 
and restart their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can 
also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to 
editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user privileges if 
they are operating out of their normal work times, if their job function or assignment 
changes, or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations. Dynamic privilege 
management includes the effects of privilege changes, for example, when there are changes 
to encryption keys used for communications.

(d) Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer 
appropriate."
AC-3,"ACCESS ENFORCEMENT 
Control: :  Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources 
in accordance with applicable access control policies. 
Discussion:  Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users 
or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, 
domains) in organizational systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the system level 
and recognizing that systems can host many applications and services in support of mission and 
business functions, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and 
service level to provide increased information security and privacy. In contrast to logical access 
controls that are implemented within the system, physical access controls are addressed by the 
controls in the Physical and Environmental Protection (
PE) family.

(2) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DUAL AUTHORIZATION 
Enforce dual authorization for [Assignment: organization-defined privileged commands 
and/or other organization-defined actions]. 
Discussion:  Dual authorization, also known as two-person control, reduces risk related to 
insider threats. Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized 
individuals to execute. To reduce the risk of collusion, organizations consider rotating dual 
authorization duties. Organizations consider the risk associated with implementing dual 
authorization mechanisms when immediate responses are necessary to ensure public and 
environmental safety.

(7) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL 
Enforce a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and objects and control 
access based upon [Assignment: organization-defined roles and users authorized to 
assume such roles]. 
Discussion:  Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that enforces access 
to objects and system functions based on the defined role (i.e., job function) of the subject. 
Organizations can create specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., 
privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with the organization-
defined roles. When users are assigned to specific roles, they inherit the authorizations or 
privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations 
because privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a large number of 
individuals) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can also increase"
AC-4,"INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT 
Control: :  Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the 
system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined 
information flow control policies]. 
Discussion:  Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and 
between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to 
subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include blocking external 
traffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information 
from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from 
the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based 
on data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an 
agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information 
between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy 
policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy 
policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy 
enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific 
architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes 
prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only), 
verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy 
domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information"
AC-5,"SEPARATION OF DUTIES 
Control: : 
a. Identify and document [Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals requiring 
separation]; and 
b. Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties. 
Discussion:  Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and 
helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes 
dividing mission or business functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, 
conducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security 
personnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. 
Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations 
consider the entirety of systems and system components when developing policy on separation 
of duties. Separation of duties is enforced through the account management activities in AC-2, 
access control mechanisms in AC-3, and identity management activities in IA-2, IA-4, and IA-12.

AC-6,"LEAST PRIVILEGE 
Control: :  Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or 
processes acting on behalf of users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned organizational 
tasks. 
Discussion:  Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and systems. The principle of 
least privilege is also applied to system processes, ensuring that the processes have access to 
systems and operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish organizational 
missions or business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, 
and accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations apply least privilege to the 
development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems.

AC-7,"UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS 
 Control: : 
a. Enforce a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid logon 
attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and 
b. Automatically [Selection (one or more): lock the account or node for an [Assignment: 
organization-defined time period]; lock the account or node until released by an 
administrator; delay next logon prompt per [Assignment: organization-defined delay 
algorithm]; notify system administrator; take other [Assignment: organization-defined 
action]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded. 
Discussion:  The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and take subsequent action when the 
maximum number of attempts is exceeded applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a 
local or network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts 
initiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined, 
organization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ 
different algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those 
components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating 
system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the 
number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to 
answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode 
with limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified 
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying 
user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC) 
address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in 
support of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to 
help prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to 
respond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is 
exceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not 
permitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need.

accounts globally, by account type, by account, or any combination thereof. For example, 
organizations may limit the number of concurrent sessions for system administrators or other 
individuals working in particularly sensitive domains or mission-critical applications. Concurrent 
session control addresses concurrent sessions for system accounts. It does not, however, address 
concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts.

AC-11,"DEVICE LOCK 
Control: : 
a. Prevent further access to the system by [Selection (one or more): initiating a device lock after 
[Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity; requiring the user to initiate a 
device lock before leaving the system unattended]; and 
b. Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and 
authentication procedures. 
Discussion:  Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent logical access to organizational 
systems when users stop work and move away from the immediate vicinity of those systems but 
do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. Device locks can be 
implemented at the operating system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be 
used to initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle). User-initiated 
device locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such, requires users to take physical action to 
initiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems, 
such as when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.

AC-12,"SESSION TERMINATION 
Control: :  Automatically terminate a user session after [Assignment: organization-defined 
conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect]. 
Discussion:  Session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions (in 
contrast to SC-10, which addresses the termination of network connections associated with 
communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect)). A logical session (for local, network, and 
remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an 
organizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated without terminating network 
sessions. Session termination ends all processes associated with a user’s logical session except 
for those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after 
the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events that require automatic termination of the 
session include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain 
types of incidents, or time-of-day restrictions on system use. 
Related Controls:  MA-4, SC-10, SC-23. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) SESSION TERMINATION | USER-INITIATED LOGOUTS  
Provide a logout capability for user-initiated communications sessions whenever 
authentication is used to gain access to [Assignment: organization-defined information 
resources]. 
Discussion:  Information resources to which users gain access via authentication include local 
workstations, databases, and password-protected websites or web-based services. 
Related Controls:  None. 
(2) SESSION TERMINATION | TERMINATION MESSAGE  
Display an explicit logout message to users indicating the termination of authenticated 
communications sessions. 
Discussion:  Logout messages for web access can be displayed after authenticated sessions 
have been terminated. However, for certain types of sessions, including file transfer protocol 
(FTP) sessions, systems typically send logout messages as final messages prior to terminating 
sessions. 
Related Controls:  None. 
(3) SESSION TERMINATION | TIMEOUT WARNING MESSAGE  
Display an explicit message to users indicating that the session will end in [Assignment: 
organization-defined time until end of session].

parameters defined in the"
AC-14,"PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION 
Control: : 
a. Identify [Assignment: organization-defined user actions] that can be performed on the 
system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational mission and 
business functions; and 
b. Document and provide supporting rationale in the security plan for the system, user actions 
not requiring identification or authentication. 
Discussion:  Specific user actions may be permitted without identification or authentication if 
organizations determine that identification and authentication are not required for the specified 
user actions. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or 
authentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible 
federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are 
received. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but 
may, under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be 
bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that 
commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored 
use. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations 
where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather 
to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may 
decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational systems without 
identification and authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can be 
“none.”

values] for information in storage, in process, and/or in transmission; 
b. Ensure that the attribute associations are made and retained with the information; 
c. Establish the following permitted security and privacy attributes from the attributes defined 
in AC-16a for [Assignment: organization-defined systems]: [Assignment: organization-defined

AC-17,"REMOTE ACCESS 
Control: : 
a. Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and 
implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and 
b. Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such connections. 
Discussion:  Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of 
users) that communicate through external networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access 
include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks 
(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted 
VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such 
connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in 
accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, 
and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does 
not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect 
the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote 
access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public 
access. 
Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing 
remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations 
may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote 
access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing 
access restrictions for remote access is addressed via AC-3.

Control: : 
a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation 
guidance for each type of wireless access; and 
b. Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections. 
Discussion:  Wireless technologies include microwave, packet radio (ultra-high frequency or very 
high frequency), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that 
provide authenticator protection and mutual authentication.

AC-19,"ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES 
Control: : 
a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation 
guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, to include when such devices are 
outside of controlled areas; and 
b. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems. 
Discussion:  A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can 
easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; 
possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power 
source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board 
sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing 
local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are 
typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability 
of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, 
depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile 
devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and 
control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which 
organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for 
protecting information and systems."

AC-20,"USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS 
Control: : 
a. [Selection (one or more): Establish [Assignment: organization-defined terms and conditions]; 
Identify [Assignment: organization-defined controls asserted to be implemented on external 
systems]], consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations 
owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to: 
1. Access the system from external systems; and 
2. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems; 
or 
b. Prohibit the use of [Assignment: organizationally-defined types of external systems]. 
Discussion:  External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems, 
and for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required 
controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned 
systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in 
commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; 
systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by, 
operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems 
also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and 
systems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the 
option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of 
external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned 
or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems). 
For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships 
that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be 
such that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may 
not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing 
information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations 
or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders, 
directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational 
personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and 
over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding 
system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be 
uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations. 
Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors 
than on state, local, or tribal governments. 
External systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope 
of AC-20
. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in 
accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and 
conditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational"
AC-20,"b: .). In other cases, 
the use of such systems or system components may be allowed but restricted in some way. 
Restrictions include requiring the implementation of approved controls prior to authorizing 
the connection of non-organizationally owned systems and components; limiting access to 
types of information, services, or applications; using virtualization techniques to limit 
processing and storage activities to servers or system components provisioned by the 
organization; and agreeing to the terms and conditions for usage. Organizations consult with 
the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using personally 
owned devices, including requirements for conducting forensic analyses during 
investigations after an incident.

defined information sharing circumstances where user discretion is required]; and 
b. Employ [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual processes] to 
assist users in making information sharing and collaboration decisions. 
Discussion:  Information sharing applies to information that may be restricted in some manner 
based on some formal or administrative determination. Examples of such information include, 
contract-sensitive information, classified information related to special access programs or 
compartments, privileged information, proprietary information, and personally identifiable 
information. Security and privacy risk assessments as well as applicable laws, regulations, and 
policies can provide useful inputs to these determinations. Depending on the circumstances, 
sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, or organizational level. Information 
may be defined by content, type, security category, or special access program or compartment. 
Access restrictions may include non-disclosure agreements (NDA). Information flow techniques 
and security attributes may be used to provide automated assistance to users making sharing 
and collaboration decisions.

Control: : 
a. Designate individuals authorized to make information publicly accessible; 
b. Train authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain

Discussion:  In accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, 
standards, and guidelines, the public is not authorized to have access to nonpublic information, 
including information protected under the [PRIVACT] and proprietary information. Publicly 
accessible content addresses systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to 
the public, typically without identification or authentication. Posting information on non-
organizational systems (e.g., non-organizational public websites, forums, and social media) is 
covered by organizational policy. While organizations may have individuals who are responsible 
for developing and implementing policies about the information that can be made publicly

AC-23,"DATA MINING PROTECTION 
Control: :  Employ [Assignment: organization-defined data mining prevention and detection 
techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined data storage objects] to detect and protect 
against unauthorized data mining. 
Discussion:  Data mining is an analytical process that attempts to find correlations or patterns in 
large data sets for the purpose of data or knowledge discovery. Data storage objects include 
database records and database fields. Sensitive information can be extracted from data mining 
operations. When information is personally identifiable information, it may lead to unanticipated 
revelations about individuals and give rise to privacy risks. Prior to performing data mining 
activities, organizations determine whether such activities are authorized. Organizations may be 
subject to applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that address data 
mining requirements. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy 
and legal counsel regarding such requirements. 
Data mining prevention and detection techniques include limiting the number and frequency of 
database queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of databases, 
limiting types of responses provided to database queries, applying differential privacy techniques 
or homomorphic encryption, and notifying personnel when atypical database queries or accesses 
occur. Data mining protection focuses on protecting information from data mining while such 
information resides in organizational data stores. In contrast,"

AC-24,"ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS 
Control: :  [Selection: Establish procedures; Implement mechanisms] to ensure [Assignment: 
organization-defined access control decisions] are applied to each access request prior to access 
enforcement. 
Discussion:  Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur when 
authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access enforcement occurs 
when systems enforce access control decisions. While it is common to have access control 
decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not required, and it is 
not always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and distributed systems, 
different entities may make access control decisions and enforce access. 
Related Controls:  AC-2, AC-3. 
 Control Enhancements: 
(1) ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | TRANSMIT ACCESS AUTHORIZATION INFORMATION  
Transmit [Assignment: organization-defined access authorization information] using 
[Assignment: organization-defined controls] to [Assignment: organization-defined 
systems] that enforce access control decisions. 
Discussion:  Authorization processes and access control decisions may occur in separate 
parts of systems or in separate systems. In such instances, authorization information is 
transmitted securely (e.g., using cryptographic mechanisms) so that timely access control 
decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To support the access control 
decisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the access authorization information 
supporting security and privacy attributes. This is because in distributed systems, there are 
various access control decisions that need to be made, and different entities make these 
decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring those attributes to make the decisions. 
Protecting access authorization information ensures that such information cannot be 
altered, spoofed, or compromised during transmission. 
Related Controls:  AU-10. 
(2) ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | NO USER OR PROCESS IDENTITY 
Enforce access control decisions based on [Assignment: organization-defined security or

without information regarding the identity of the users issuing the requests. These are 
generally instances where preserving individual privacy is of paramount importance. In other"
AC-25,"REFERENCE MONITOR  
 Control: :  Implement a reference monitor for [Assignment: organization-defined access control 
policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be subject to analysis and 
testing, the completeness of which can be assured. 
Discussion:  A reference monitor is a set of design requirements on a reference validation 
mechanism that, as a key component of an operating system, enforces an access control policy 
over all subjects and objects. A reference validation mechanism is always invoked, tamper-proof, 
and small enough to be subject to analysis and tests, the completeness of which can be assured 
(i.e., verifiable). Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known as 
data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and 
passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are associated with individuals, devices, or 
processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are associated 
with data structures, such as records, buffers, communications ports, tables, files, and inter-
process pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control policies that restrict access to objects 
based on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The system enforces 
the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamper-proof 
property of the reference monitor prevents determined adversaries from compromising the 
functioning of the reference validation mechanism. The always invoked property prevents 
adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and violating the security policy. The smallness 
property helps to ensure completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect 
any weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the 
security policy.

AT-1,"POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Control: : 
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]: 
1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business process-level; System-
level] awareness and training policy that: 
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the awareness and training policy and 
the associated awareness and training controls; 
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development,

c. Review and update the current awareness and training: 
1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]; and 
2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Awareness and training policy and procedures address the controls in the AT family 
that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an 
important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute 
to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs 
collaborate on the development of awareness and training policy and procedures. Security and 
privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and 
may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be 
included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies 
that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and 
privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures 
describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or 
role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and 
privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to 
awareness and training policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security 
incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an 
organizational policy or procedure.

c. Update literacy training and awareness content [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and 
d. Incorporate lessons learned from internal or external security incidents or breaches into 
literacy training and awareness techniques. 
Discussion:  Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of literacy training to system users, 
including measures to test the knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of 
literacy training and awareness based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to 
which personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content 
includes an understanding of the need for security and privacy as well as actions by users to 
maintain security and personal privacy and to respond to suspected incidents. The content 
addresses the need for operations security and the handling of personally identifiable 
information. 
Awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security and 
privacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices from 
organizational officials, and conducting awareness events. Literacy training after the initial 
training described in AT-2a.1 is conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with applicable 
laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Subsequent literacy training may be satisfied by one or 
more short ad hoc sessions and include topical information on recent attack schemes, changes to 
organizational security and privacy policies, revised security and privacy expectations, or a subset 
of topics from the initial training. Updating literacy training and awareness content on a regular 
basis helps to ensure that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to 
literacy training and awareness content include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit 
findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, 
directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

AT-3,"ROLE: -BASED TRAINING 
Control: 
a. Provide role-based security and privacy training to personnel with the following roles and 
responsibilities: [Assignment: organization-defined roles and responsibilities]: 
1. Before authorizing access to the system, information, or performing assigned duties, 
and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter; and 
2. When required by system changes; 
b. Update role-based training content [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and 
following [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and 
c. Incorporate lessons learned from internal or external security incidents or breaches into 
role-based training. 
Discussion:  Organizations determine the content of training based on the assigned roles and 
responsibilities of individuals as well as the security and privacy requirements of organizations 
and the systems to which personnel have authorized access, including technical training 
specifically tailored for assigned duties. Roles that may require role-based training include senior 
leaders or management officials (e.g., head of agency/chief executive officer, chief information 
officer, senior accountable official for risk management, senior agency information security 
officer, senior agency official for privacy), system owners; authorizing officials; system security 
officers; privacy officers; acquisition and procurement officials; enterprise architects; systems 
engineers; software developers; systems security engineers; privacy engineers; system, network, 
and database administrators; auditors; personnel conducting configuration management 
activities; personnel performing verification and validation activities; personnel with access to 
system-level software; control assessors; personnel with contingency planning and incident 
response duties; personnel with privacy management responsibilities; and personnel with access 
to personally identifiable information. 
Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and 
responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical controls. Role-based training also 
includes policies, procedures, tools, methods, and artifacts for the security and privacy roles 
defined. Organizations provide the training necessary for individuals to fulfill their responsibilities 
related to operations and supply chain risk management within the context of organizational 
security and privacy programs. Role-based training also applies to contractors who provide

Discussion:  Training feedback includes awareness training results and role-based training results. 
Training results, especially failures of personnel in critical roles, can be indicative of a potentially 
serious problem. Therefore, it is important that senior managers are made aware of such 
situations so that they can take appropriate response actions. Training feedback supports the

Control: : 
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]: 
1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business process-level; System-
level] audit and accountability policy that: 
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the audit and accountability policy and 
the associated audit and accountability controls; 
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, 
documentation, and dissemination of the audit and accountability policy and procedures; 
and 
c. Review and update the current audit and accountability: 
1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]; and 
2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Audit and accountability policy and procedures address the controls in the AU family 
that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an 
important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute 
to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs 
collaborate on the development of audit and accountability policy and procedures. Security and 
privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and 
may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be 
included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies 
that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and 
privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures 
describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or 
role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and 
privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to 
audit and accountability policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security 
incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an 
organizational policy or procedure.

AU-2,"EVENT LOGGING 
 Control: : 
a. Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit 
function: [Assignment: organization-defined event types that the system is capable of 
logging]; 
b. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-
related information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged; 
c. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-
defined event types (subset of the event types defined in AU-2a.) along with the frequency of 
(or situation requiring) logging for each identified event type]; 
d. Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate 
to support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and 
e. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency]. 
Discussion:  An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require 
logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the 
privacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event 
types include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or 
privacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action 
changes, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types 
that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of 
the controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are 
operational and supported by the system. 
To balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging 
requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For 
example, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access 
successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due 
to the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to 
be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help 
ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization. 
Organizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals 
that may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the 
potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging 
event is based on patterns or time of usage. 
Event logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in 
other controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1), 
CM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), 
SI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable 
laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records 
can be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the 
network. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring 
and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types, 
organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in 
distributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented 
architectures.

AU-3,"CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS 
 Control: :  Ensure that audit records contain information that establishes the following: 
a. What type of event occurred; 
b. When the event occurred; 
c. Where the event occurred; 
d. Source of the event; 
e. Outcome of the event; and  
f. Identity of any individuals, subjects, or objects/entities associated with the event. 
Discussion:  Audit record content that may be necessary to support the auditing function 
includes event descriptions (item a), time stamps (item b), source and destination addresses 
(item c), user or process identifiers (items d and f), success or fail indications (item e), and 
filenames involved (items a, c, e, and f) . Event outcomes include indicators of event success or 
failure and event-specific results, such as the system security and privacy posture after the event 
occurred. Organizations consider how audit records can reveal information about individuals that 
may give rise to privacy risks and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the 
potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the trail 
records inputs or is based on patterns or time of usage.

Control Enhancements: 
(1) CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | ADDITIONAL AUDIT INFORMATION  
Generate audit records containing the following additional information: [Assignment: 
organization-defined additional information]. 
Discussion:  The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on 
system functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider 
additional information in audit records including, but not limited to, access control or flow 
control rules invoked and individual identities of group account users. Organizations may 
also consider limiting additional audit record information to only information that is 
explicitly needed for audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs 
by not including information in audit records that could potentially be misleading, make it 
more difficult to locate information of interest, or increase the risk to individuals' privacy. 
Related Controls:  None."
AU-4,"AUDIT LOG STORAGE CAPACITY 
Control: :  Allocate audit log storage capacity to accommodate [Assignment: organization-defined 
audit log retention requirements]. 
Discussion:  Organizations consider the types of audit logging to be performed and the audit log 
processing requirements when allocating audit log storage capacity. Allocating sufficient audit 
log storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the 
potential loss or reduction of audit logging capability. 
Related Controls:  AU-2, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-9, AU-11, AU-12, AU-14, SI-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) AUDIT LOG STORAGE CAPACITY | TRANSFER TO ALTERNATE STORAGE  
Transfer audit logs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to a different system, 
system component, or media other than the system or system component conducting the 
logging. 
Discussion:  Audit log transfer, also known as off-loading, is a common process in systems 
with limited audit log storage capacity and thus supports availability of the audit logs. The 
initial audit log storage is only used in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate 
with the secondary or alternate system allocated to audit log storage, at which point the 
audit logs are transferred. Transferring audit logs to alternate storage is similar to AU-9(2) in 
that audit logs are transferred to a different entity. However, the purpose of selecting AU-
9(2) is to protect the confidentiality and integrity of audit records. Organizations can select 
either control enhancement to obtain the benefit of increased audit log storage capacity and 
preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of audit records and logs.

b. Report findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; and 
c. Adjust the level of audit record review, analysis, and reporting within the system when there 
is a change in risk based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other 
credible sources of information. 
Discussion:  Audit record review, analysis, and reporting covers information security- and privacy-
related logging performed by organizations, including logging that results from the monitoring of 
account usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration 
settings, system component inventory, use of maintenance tools and non-local maintenance, 
physical access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal, communications at 
system interfaces, and use of mobile code or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Findings can be 
reported to organizational entities that include the incident response team, help desk, and 
security or privacy offices. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit 
records or unable to conduct such activities, the review or analysis may be carried out by other 
organizations granted such authority. The frequency, scope, and/or depth of the audit record 
review, analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to meet organizational needs based on new

 Control: : 
a. Use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and 
b. Record time stamps for audit records that meet [Assignment: organization-defined 
granularity of time measurement] and that use Coordinated Universal Time, have a fixed 
local time offset from Coordinated Universal Time, or that include the local time offset as 
part of the time stamp. 
Discussion:  Time stamps generated by the system include date and time. Time is commonly 
expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time 
(GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the 
degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing 
within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time 
granularities for different system components. Time service can be critical to other security 
capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the 
nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.

b. Alert [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] upon detection of unauthorized 
access, modification, or deletion of audit information. 
Discussion:  Audit information includes all information needed to successfully audit system 
activity, such as audit records, audit log settings, audit reports, and personally identifiable 
information. Audit logging tools are those programs and devices used to conduct system audit 
and logging activities. Protection of audit information focuses on technical protection and limits 
the ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. Physical protection 
of audit information is addressed by both media protection controls and physical and 
environmental protection controls.

Control Enhancements: 
(1) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | HARDWARE WRITE-ONCE MEDIA 
Write audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media. 
Discussion:  Writing audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media applies to the initial 
generation of audit trails (i.e., the collection of audit records that represents the information 
to be used for detection, analysis, and reporting purposes) and to the backup of those audit 
trails. Writing audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media does not apply to the 
initial generation of audit records prior to being written to an audit trail. Write-once, read-
many (WORM) media includes Compact Disc-Recordable (CD-R), Blu-Ray Disc Recordable 
(BD-R), and Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable (DVD-R). In contrast, the use of switchable 
write-protection media, such as tape cartridges, Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives, Compact 
Disc Re-Writeable (CD-RW), and Digital Versatile Disc-Read Write (DVD-RW) results in write-
protected but not write-once media.

(2) PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | STORE ON SEPARATE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS OR COMPONENTS  
Store audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] in a repository that is 
part of a physically different system or system component than the system or component 
being audited. 
Discussion:  Storing audit records in a repository separate from the audited system or system 
component helps to ensure that a compromise of the system being audited does not also 
result in a compromise of the audit records. Storing audit records on separate physical 
systems or components also preserves the confidentiality and integrity of audit records and 
facilitates the management of audit records as an organization-wide activity. Storing audit 
records on separate systems or components applies to initial generation as well as backup or 
long-term storage of audit records.

Control:  Provide irrefutable evidence that an individual (or process acting on behalf of an 
individual) has performed [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be covered by non-
repudiation]. 
Discussion:  Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include creating information, 
sending and receiving messages, and approving information. Non-repudiation protects against 
claims by authors of not having authored certain documents, senders of not having transmitted 
messages, receivers of not having received messages, and signatories of not having signed 
documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an 
individual or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, 
approving a procurement request, or receiving specific information). Organizations obtain non-
repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms, including digital signatures 
and digital message receipts.

(b) Provide the means for authorized individuals to determine the identity of the 
producer of the information. 
Discussion:  Binding identities to the information supports audit requirements that provide 
organizational personnel with the means to identify who produced specific information in 
the event of an information transfer. Organizations determine and approve the strength of 
attribute binding between the information producer and the information based on the 
security category of the information and other relevant risk factors.

Discussion:  Session audits can include monitoring keystrokes, tracking websites visited, and 
recording information and/or file transfers. Session audit capability is implemented in addition to 
event logging and may involve implementation of specialized session capture technology. 
Organizations consider how session auditing can reveal information about individuals that may 
give rise to privacy risk as well as how to mitigate those risks. Because session auditing can 
impact system and network performance, organizations activate the capability under well-
defined situations (e.g., the organization is suspicious of a specific individual). Organizations 
consult with legal counsel, civil liberties officials, and privacy officials to ensure that any legal, 
privacy, civil rights, or civil liberties issues, including the use of personally identifiable 
information, are appropriately addressed.

AU-16,"CROSS: -ORGANIZATIONAL AUDIT LOGGING 
 Control:  Employ [Assignment: organization-defined methods] for coordinating [Assignment: 
organization-defined audit information] among external organizations when audit information is 
transmitted across organizational boundaries. 
Discussion:  When organizations use systems or services of external organizations, the audit 
logging capability necessitates a coordinated, cross-organization approach. For example, 
maintaining the identity of individuals who request specific services across organizational 
boundaries may often be difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance and 
privacy ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational audit logging simply 
captures the identity of individuals who issue requests at the initial system, and subsequent 
systems record that the requests originated from authorized individuals. Organizations consider 
including processes for coordinating audit information requirements and protection of audit 
information in information exchange agreements. 
Related Controls:  AU-3, AU-6, AU-7, CA-3, PT-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDIT LOGGING | IDENTITY PRESERVATION  
Preserve the identity of individuals in cross-organizational audit trails. 
Discussion:  Identity preservation is applied when there is a need to be able to trace actions 
that are performed across organizational boundaries to a specific individual. 
Related Controls:  IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8. 
(2) CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDIT LOGGING | SHARING OF AUDIT INFORMATION  
Provide cross-organizational audit information to [Assignment: organization-defined 
organizations] based on [Assignment: organization-defined cross-organizational sharing 
agreements]. 
Discussion:  Due to the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-organization 
sharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the auditing being 
performed. For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide sufficient 
information to determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational information 
resources by individuals in other organizations. In some instances, only individuals’ home 
organizations have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations, thus requiring 
the sharing of audit information among organizations. 
Related Controls:  IR-4, SI-4. 
(3) CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING | DISASSOCIABILITY 
Implement [Assignment: organization-defined measures] to disassociate individuals from 
audit information transmitted across organizational boundaries. 
Discussion:  Preserving identities in audit trails could have privacy ramifications, such as 
enabling the tracking and profiling of individuals, but may not be operationally necessary. 
These risks could be further amplified when transmitting information across organizational 
boundaries. Implementing privacy-enhancing cryptographic techniques can disassociate 
individuals from audit information and reduce privacy risk while maintaining accountability."
CA-1,"POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Control: : 
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]: 
1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business process-level; System-
level] assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy that: 
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the assessment, authorization, and 
monitoring policy and the associated assessment, authorization, and monitoring 
controls; 
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, 
documentation, and dissemination of the assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy 
and procedures; and 
c. Review and update the current assessment, authorization, and monitoring: 
1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]; and 
2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy and procedures address the 
controls in the CA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk 
management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies 
and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that 
security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of assessment, authorization, and 
monitoring policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the 
organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-
specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and 
privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of 
organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or 
business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls 
are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. 
Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate 
documents. Events that may precipitate an update to assessment, authorization, and monitoring 
policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or 
changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and 
guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

CA-2,"CONTROL ASSESSMENTS 
 Control: : 
a. Select the appropriate assessor or assessment team for the type of assessment to be 
conducted; 
b. Develop a control assessment plan that describes the scope of the assessment including: 
1. Controls and control enhancements under assessment; 
2. Assessment procedures to be used to determine control effectiveness; and 
3. Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilities; 
c. Ensure the control assessment plan is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or 
designated representative prior to conducting the assessment; 
d. Assess the controls in the system and its environment of operation [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency] to determine the extent to which the controls are 
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with 
respect to meeting established security and privacy requirements; 
e. Produce a control assessment report that document the results of the assessment; and 
f. Provide the results of the control assessment to [Assignment: organization-defined 
individuals or roles]. 
Discussion:  Organizations ensure that control assessors possess the required skills and technical 
expertise to develop effective assessment plans and to conduct assessments of system-specific, 
hybrid, common, and program management controls, as appropriate. The required skills include 
general knowledge of risk management concepts and approaches as well as comprehensive 
knowledge of and experience with the hardware, software, and firmware system components 
implemented. 
Organizations assess controls in systems and the environments in which those systems operate 
as part of initial and ongoing authorizations, continuous monitoring, FISMA annual assessments, 
system design and development, systems security engineering, privacy engineering, and the 
system development life cycle. Assessments help to ensure that organizations meet information 
security and privacy requirements, identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the system design and 
development process, provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part 
of authorization processes, and comply with vulnerability mitigation procedures. Organizations 
conduct assessments on the implemented controls as documented in security and privacy plans. 
Assessments can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of 
systems engineering and systems security engineering processes. The design for controls can be 
assessed as RFPs are developed, responses assessed, and design reviews conducted. If a design 
to implement controls and subsequent implementation in accordance with the design are 
assessed during development, the final control testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing 
previously completed control assessment and aggregating the outcomes. 
Organizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment plan for the 
system or maintain separate plans. A consolidated assessment plan clearly delineates the roles 
and responsibilities for control assessment. If multiple organizations participate in assessing a 
system, a coordinated approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs. 
Organizations can use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability scanning and 
system monitoring, to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during the system"
CA-3,"INFORMATION EXCHANGE 
 Control: : 
a. Approve and manage the exchange of information between the system and other systems 
using [Selection (one or more): interconnection security agreements; information exchange 
security agreements; memoranda of understanding or agreement; service level agreements;"
CA-5,"PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES 
 Control: : 
a. Develop a plan of action and milestones for the system to document the planned 
remediation actions of the organization to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during 
the assessment of the controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the 
system; and 
b. Update existing plan of action and milestones [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] 
based on the findings from control assessments, independent audits or reviews, and 
continuous monitoring activities. 
Discussion:  Plans of action and milestones are useful for any type of organization to track 
planned remedial actions. Plans of action and milestones are required in authorization packages 
and subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB. 
Related Controls:  CA-2, CA-7, PM-4, PM-9, RA-7, SI-2, SI-12."
CA-6,"AUTHORIZATION 
Control: : 
a. Assign a senior official as the authorizing official for the system; 
b. Assign a senior official as the authorizing official for common controls available for 
inheritance by organizational systems; 
c. Ensure that the authorizing official for the system, before commencing operations: 
1. Accepts the use of common controls inherited by the system; and 
2. Authorizes the system to operate; 
d. Ensure that the authorizing official for common controls authorizes the use of those controls 
for inheritance by organizational systems; 
e. Update the authorizations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Discussion:  Authorizations are official management decisions by senior officials to authorize 
operation of systems, authorize the use of common controls for inheritance by organizational 
systems, and explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of agreed-upon controls. Authorizing 
officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational systems and common controls or assume 
responsibility for the mission and business functions supported by those systems or common 
controls. The authorization process is a federal responsibility, and therefore, authorizing officials 
must be federal employees. Authorizing officials are both responsible and accountable for 
security and privacy risks associated with the operation and use of organizational systems. 
Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes to authorize systems and senior officials 
that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities. 
Authorizing officials issue ongoing authorizations of systems based on evidence produced from 
implemented continuous monitoring programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs reduce 
the need for separate reauthorization processes. Through the employment of comprehensive 
continuous monitoring processes, the information contained in authorization packages (i.e., 
security and privacy plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on 
an ongoing basis. This provides authorizing officials, common control providers, and system 
owners with an up-to-date status of the security and privacy posture of their systems, controls, 
and operating environments. To reduce the cost of reauthorization, authorizing officials can 
leverage the results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the 
basis for rendering reauthorization decisions."

CA-8,"PENETRATION TESTING 
 Control: :  Conduct penetration testing [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] on 
[Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components]. 
Discussion:  Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on systems or 
individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. 
Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents 
and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, 
operating system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to validate 
vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries 
within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Penetration 
testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of 
security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially 
important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies 
(e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). 
Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing 
activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware, 
software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical 
controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes a pretest analysis based on full 
knowledge of the system, pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest 
analysis, and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All parties agree 
to the rules of engagement before commencing penetration testing scenarios. Organizations 
correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the tools, techniques, and 
procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries. Penetration testing may result in 
the exposure of information that is protected by laws or regulations, to individuals conducting 
the testing. Rules of engagement, contracts, or other appropriate mechanisms can be used to 
communicate expectations for how to protect this information. Risk assessments guide the 
decisions on the level of independence required for the personnel conducting penetration 
testing. 
Related Controls:  RA-5, RA-10, SA-11, SR-5, SR-6. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) PENETRATION TESTING | INDEPENDENT PENETRATION TESTING AGENT OR TEAM  
Employ an independent penetration testing agent or team to perform penetration testing 
on the system or system components. 
Discussion:  Independent penetration testing agents or teams are individuals or groups who 
conduct impartial penetration testing of organizational systems. Impartiality implies that 
penetration testing agents or teams are free from perceived or actual conflicts of interest 
with respect to the development, operation, or management of the systems that are the 
targets of the penetration testing. CA-2(1) provides additional information on independent 
assessments that can be applied to penetration testing. 
Related Controls:  CA-2. 
(2) PENETRATION TESTING | RED TEAM EXERCISES 
Employ the following red-team exercises to simulate attempts by adversaries to 
compromise organizational systems in accordance with applicable rules of engagement: 
[Assignment: organization-defined red team exercises]. 
Discussion:  Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by examining 
the security and privacy posture of organizations and the capability to implement effective 
cyber defenses. Red team exercises simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise 
mission and business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the security and"
CA-9,"INTERNAL SYSTEM CONNECTIONS 
 Control: : 
a. Authorize internal connections of [Assignment: organization-defined system components or 
classes of components] to the system; 
b. Document, for each internal connection, the interface characteristics, security and privacy 
requirements, and the nature of the information communicated; 
c. Terminate internal system connections after [Assignment: organization-defined conditions]; 
and 
d. Review [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the continued need for each internal 
connection. 
Discussion:  Internal system connections are connections between organizational systems and 
separate constituent system components (i.e., connections between components that are part of 
the same system) including components used for system development. Intra-system connections 
include connections with mobile devices, notebook and desktop computers, tablets, printers, 
copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each internal 
system connection individually, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of 
system components with common characteristics and/or configurations, including printers, 
scanners, and copiers with a specified processing, transmission, and storage capability or smart 
phones and tablets with a specific baseline configuration. The continued need for an internal 
system connection is reviewed from the perspective of whether it provides support for 
organizational missions or business functions.

Discussion:  Configuration management policy and procedures address the controls in the CM 
family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is 
an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures 
contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy 
programs collaborate on the development of configuration management policy and procedures. 
Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in 
general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The 
policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by 
multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established 
for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. 
Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the 
individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system 
security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an 
update to configuration management policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, 
assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws,

a. Develop, document, and maintain under configuration control, a current baseline 
configuration of the system; and 
b. Review and update the baseline configuration of the system: 
1. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
2. When required due to [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances]; and 
3. When system components are installed or upgraded. 
Discussion:  Baseline configurations for systems and system components include connectivity, 
operational, and communications aspects of systems. Baseline configurations are documented, 
formally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for systems or configuration items within 
those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to 
systems and include security and privacy control implementations, operational procedures, 
information about system components, network topology, and logical placement of components 
in the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines 
as organizational systems change over time. Baseline configurations of systems reflect the 
current enterprise architecture.

Discussion:  Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent baseline 
configurations for systems include configuration management tools, hardware, software, 
firmware inventory tools, and network management tools. Automated tools can be used at 
the organization level, mission and business process level, or system level on workstations, 
servers, notebook computers, network components, or mobile devices. Tools can be used to 
track version numbers on operating systems, applications, types of software installed, and 
current patch levels. Automation support for accuracy and currency can be satisfied by the 
implementation of 
CM-8(2) for organizations that combine system component inventory and

CM-4,"IMPACT ANALYSES 
Control: :  Analyze changes to the system to determine potential security and privacy impacts 
prior to change implementation. 
Discussion:  Organizational personnel with security or privacy responsibilities conduct impact 
analyses. Individuals conducting impact analyses possess the necessary skills and technical 
expertise to analyze the changes to systems as well as the security or privacy ramifications. 
Impact analyses include reviewing security and privacy plans, policies, and procedures to 
understand control requirements; reviewing system design documentation and operational 
procedures to understand control implementation and how specific system changes might affect 
the controls; reviewing the impact of changes on organizational supply chain partners with 
stakeholders; and determining how potential changes to a system create new risks to the privacy 
of individuals and the ability of implemented controls to mitigate those risks. Impact analyses 
also include risk assessments to understand the impact of the changes and determine if 
additional controls are required.

(1) IMPACT ANALYSES | SEPARATE TEST ENVIRONMENTS  
Analyze changes to the system in a separate test environment before implementation in 
an operational environment, looking for security and privacy impacts due to flaws, 
weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice. 
Discussion:  A separate test environment requires an environment that is physically or 
logically separate and distinct from the operational environment. The separation is sufficient 
to ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact activities in the operational 
environment and that information in the operational environment is not inadvertently 
transmitted to the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or

Discussion:  Configuration settings are the parameters that can be changed in the hardware, 
software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security and privacy posture or 
functionality of the system. Information technology products for which configuration settings can 
be defined include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, operating systems, mobile 
devices, input/output devices, protocols, and applications. Parameters that impact the security 
posture of systems include registry settings; account, file, or directory permission settings; and 
settings for functions, protocols, ports, services, and remote connections. Privacy parameters are 
parameters impacting the privacy posture of systems, including the parameters required to 
satisfy other privacy controls. Privacy parameters include settings for access controls, data 
processing preferences, and processing and retention permissions. Organizations establish 
organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings 
for systems. The established settings become part of the configuration baseline for the system. 
Common secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists, lockdown and 
hardening guides, and security reference guides) provide recognized, standardized, and 
established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for information technology"

the specific system components on which the information is processed and stored; 
b. Identify and document the users who have access to the system and system components 
where the information is processed and stored; and 
c. Document changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where the 
information is processed and stored. 
Discussion:  Information location addresses the need to understand where information is being 
processed and stored. Information location includes identifying where specific information types 
and information reside in system components and how information is being processed so that 
information flow can be understood and adequate protection and policy management provided 
for such information and system components. The security category of the information is also a 
factor in determining the controls necessary to protect the information and the system 
component where the information resides (see FIPS 199). The location of the information and 
system components is also a factor in the architecture and design of the system (see SA-4, SA-8, 
SA-17).

Discussion:  The use of automated tools helps to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of 
the information location capability implemented within the system. Automation also helps 
organizations manage the data produced during information location activities and share 
such information across the organization. The output of automated information location 
tools can be used to guide and inform system architecture and design decisions.

that is recognized and approved by the organization. 
Discussion:  Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless signed with 
recognized and approved certificates include software and firmware version updates, patches, 
service packs, device drivers, and basic input/output system updates. Organizations can identify 
applicable software and firmware components by type, by specific items, or a combination of 
both. Digital signatures and organizational verification of such signatures is a method of code 
authentication.

Control: : 
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]: 
1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business process-level; System-
level] contingency planning policy that: 
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning policy and the 
associated contingency planning controls; 
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, 
documentation, and dissemination of the contingency planning policy and procedures; and 
c. Review and update the current contingency planning: 
1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]; and 
2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Contingency planning policy and procedures address the controls in the CP family 
that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an 
important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute 
to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs 
collaborate on the development of contingency planning policy and procedures. Security and 
privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and 
may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be 
included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies 
that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and 
privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures 
describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or 
role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and 
privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to 
contingency planning policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security 
incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy 
or procedure.

CP-2,"CONTINGENCY PLAN 
 Control: : 
a. Develop a contingency plan for the system that: 
1. Identifies essential mission and business functions and associated contingency 
requirements; 
2. Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics; 
3. Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact 
information; 
4. Addresses maintaining essential mission and business functions despite a system 
disruption, compromise, or failure;  
5. Addresses eventual, full system restoration without deterioration of the controls 
originally planned and implemented; 
6. Addresses the sharing of contingency information; and 
7. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; 
b. Distribute copies of the contingency plan to [Assignment: organization-defined key 
contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; 
c. Coordinate contingency planning activities with incident handling activities; 
d. Review the contingency plan for the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
e. Update the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, system, or 
environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan 
implementation, execution, or testing; 
f. Communicate contingency plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined key 
contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements]; 
g. Incorporate lessons learned from contingency plan testing, training, or actual contingency 
activities into contingency testing and training; and 
h. Protect the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification. 
Discussion:  Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving 
continuity of operations for organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning 
addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes 
when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the 
system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be 
designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans 
reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need 
to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery 
objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, 
guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level. 
Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown, 
fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for 
when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling 
activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in 
the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an 
incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4(5). 
Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in 
the IR (Incident Response) family."
CP-3,"CONTINGENCY TRAINING 
 Control: :

b. Review the contingency plan test results; and"
CP-6,"ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE 
 Control: : 
a. Establish an alternate storage site, including necessary agreements to permit the storage 
and retrieval of system backup information; and 
b. Ensure that the alternate storage site provides controls equivalent to that of the primary 
site. 
Discussion:  Alternate storage sites are geographically distinct from primary storage sites and 
maintain duplicate copies of information and data if the primary storage site is not available. 
Similarly, alternate processing sites provide processing capability if the primary processing site is 
not available. Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency requirements 
may be considered alternate storage sites. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements 
include environmental conditions at the alternate sites, access rules for systems and facilities, 
physical and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of delivery and retrieval 
of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that 
organizations can maintain essential mission and business functions despite compromise, failure, 
or disruption in organizational systems. 
Related Controls:  CP-2, CP-7, CP-8, CP-9, CP-10, MP-4, MP-5, PE-3, SC-36, SI-13.

assessments and include natural disasters, structural failures, hostile attacks, and errors of"
CP-7,"ALTERNATE PROCESSING SITE 
 Control: : 
a. Establish an alternate processing site, including necessary agreements to permit the transfer 
and resumption of [Assignment: organization-defined system operations] for essential 
mission and business functions within [Assignment: organization-defined time period 
consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives] when the primary processing 
capabilities are unavailable; 
b. Make available at the alternate processing site, the equipment and supplies required to 
transfer and resume operations or put contracts in place to support delivery to the site 
within the organization-defined time period for transfer and resumption; and 
c. Provide controls at the alternate processing site that are equivalent to those at the primary 
site. 
Discussion:  Alternate processing sites are geographically distinct from primary processing sites 
and provide processing capability if the primary processing site is not available. The alternate 
processing capability may be addressed using a physical processing site or other alternatives, 
such as failover to a cloud-based service provider or other internally or externally provided 
processing service. Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency 
requirements may also be considered alternate processing sites. Controls that are covered by 
alternate processing site agreements include the environmental conditions at alternate sites, 
access rules, physical and environmental protection requirements, and the coordination for the 
transfer and assignment of personnel. Requirements are allocated to alternate processing sites"
CP-8,"TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES 
 Control: :  Establish alternate telecommunications services, including necessary agreements to 
permit the resumption of [Assignment: organization-defined system operations] for essential 
mission and business functions within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when the 
primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the primary or alternate 
processing or storage sites. 
Discussion:  Telecommunications services (for data and voice) for primary and alternate 
processing and storage sites are in scope for CP-8. Alternate telecommunications services reflect 
the continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential mission and business 
functions despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify 
different time periods for primary or alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services 
include additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits or lines, network-based 
approaches to telecommunications, or the use of satellites. Organizations consider factors such 
as availability, quality of service, and access when entering into alternate telecommunications 
agreements. 
Related Controls:  CP-2, CP-6, CP-7, CP-11, SC-7. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | PRIORITY OF SERVICE PROVISIONS 
(a) Develop primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain 
priority-of-service provisions in accordance with availability requirements (including 
recovery time objectives); and 
(b) Request Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used 
for national security emergency preparedness if the primary and/or alternate 
telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier. 
Discussion:  Organizations consider the potential mission or business impact in situations 
where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with similar 
priority of service provisions. Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) is a Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) program that directs telecommunications service 
providers (e.g., wireline and wireless phone companies) to give preferential treatment to 
users enrolled in the program when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored 
following a disruption of service, regardless of the cause. The FCC sets the rules and policies 
for the TSP program, and the Department of Homeland Security manages the TSP program. 
The TSP program is always in effect and not contingent on a major disaster or attack taking 
place. Federal sponsorship is required to enroll in the TSP program. 
Related Controls:  None. 
(2) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE  
Obtain alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single 
point of failure with primary telecommunications services. 
Discussion:  In certain circumstances, telecommunications service providers or services may 
share the same physical lines, which increases the vulnerability of a single failure point. It is 
important to have provider transparency for the actual physical transmission capability for 
telecommunication services."
CP-9,"SYSTEM BACKUP 
 Control: :

system components] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery 
time and recovery point objectives]; 
b. Conduct backups of system-level information contained in the system [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives];"
MP-5,"and SC: -8. System backups reflect the 
requirements in contingency plans as well as other organizational requirements for backing up 
information. Organizations may be subject to laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or 
policies with requirements regarding specific categories of information (e.g., personal health 
information). Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and 
legal counsel regarding such requirements.

Control Enhancements: 
(1) SYSTEM BACKUP | TESTING FOR RELIABILITY AND INTEGRITY  
Test backup information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to verify media 
reliability and information integrity. 
Discussion:  Organizations need assurance that backup information can be reliably retrieved. 
Reliability pertains to the systems and system components where the backup information is 
stored, the operations used to retrieve the information, and the integrity of the information 
being retrieved. Independent and specialized tests can be used for each of the aspects of 
reliability. For example, decrypting and transporting (or transmitting) a random sample of 
backup files from the alternate storage or backup site and comparing the information to the 
same information at the primary processing site can provide such assurance.  
Related Controls:  CP-4. 
(2) SYSTEM BACKUP | TEST RESTORATION USING SAMPLING  
Use a sample of backup information in the restoration of selected system functions as part 
of contingency plan testing. 
Discussion:  Organizations need assurance that system functions can be restored correctly 
and can support established organizational missions. To ensure that the selected system 
functions are thoroughly exercised during contingency plan testing, a sample of backup 
information is retrieved to determine whether the functions are operating as intended. 
Organizations can determine the sample size for the functions and backup information 
based on the level of assurance needed. 
Related Controls:  CP-4. 
(3) SYSTEM BACKUP | SEPARATE STORAGE FOR CRITICAL INFORMATION  
Store backup copies of [Assignment: organization-defined critical system software and 
other security-related information] in a separate facility or in a fire rated container that is

Discussion:  Separate storage for critical information applies to all critical information 
regardless of the type of backup storage media. Critical system software includes operating 
systems, middleware, cryptographic key management systems, and intrusion detection 
systems. Security-related information includes inventories of system hardware, software, 
and firmware components. Alternate storage sites, including geographically distributed 
architectures, serve as separate storage facilities for organizations. Organizations may"
CP-10,"SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION 
 Control: :  Provide for the recovery and reconstitution of the system to a known state within 
[Assignment: organization-defined time period consistent with recovery time and recovery point 
objectives] after a disruption, compromise, or failure. 
Discussion:  Recovery is executing contingency plan activities to restore organizational mission 
and business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities for 
returning systems to fully operational states. Recovery and reconstitution operations reflect 
mission and business priorities; recovery point, recovery time, and reconstitution objectives; and 
organizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes 
the deactivation of interim system capabilities that may have been needed during recovery 
operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully restored system capabilities, 
reestablishment of continuous monitoring activities, system reauthorization (if required), and 
activities to prepare the system and organization for future disruptions, breaches, compromises, 
or failures. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities can include automated mechanisms and 
manual procedures.
 Organizations establish recovery time and recovery point objectives as part 
of contingency planning.

Discussion:  Contingency plans and the contingency training or testing associated with those 
plans incorporate an alternate communications protocol capability as part of establishing 
resilience in organizational systems. Switching communications protocols may affect software 
applications and operational aspects of systems. Organizations assess the potential side effects 
of introducing alternate communications protocols prior to implementation.

CP-12,"SAFE MODE 
 Control: :  When [Assignment: organization-defined conditions] are detected, enter a safe mode of 
operation with [Assignment: organization-defined restrictions of safe mode of operation]. 
Discussion:  For systems that support critical mission and business functions—including military 
operations, civilian space operations, nuclear power plant operations, and air traffic control 
operations (especially real-time operational environments)—organizations can identify certain 
conditions under which those systems revert to a predefined safe mode of operation. The safe 
mode of operation, which can be activated either automatically or manually, restricts the 
operations that systems can execute when those conditions are encountered. Restriction 
includes allowing only selected functions to execute that can be carried out under limited power 
or with reduced communications bandwidth.

CP-13,"ALTERNATIVE SECURITY MECHANISMS 
 Control: :  Employ [Assignment: organization-defined alternative or supplemental security 
mechanisms] for satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined security functions] when the 
primary means of implementing the security function is unavailable or compromised. 
Discussion:  Use of alternative security mechanisms supports system resiliency, contingency 
planning, and continuity of operations. To ensure mission and business continuity, organizations 
can implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. The mechanisms may be less 
effective than the primary mechanisms. However, having the capability to readily employ 
alternative or supplemental mechanisms enhances mission and business continuity that might 
otherwise be adversely impacted if operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of 
implementing the functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to provide 
such alternative capabilities, the alternative or supplemental mechanisms are only applied to 
critical security capabilities provided by systems, system components, or system services. For 
example, an organization may issue one-time pads to senior executives, officials, and system 
administrators if multi-factor tokens—the standard means for achieving secure authentication— 
are compromised.

level] identification and authentication policy that: 
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication 
policy and the associated identification and authentication controls; 
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, 
documentation, and dissemination of the identification and authentication policy and

c. Review and update the current identification and authentication: 
1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]; and 
2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Identification and authentication policy and procedures address the controls in the 
IA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy 
is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures 
contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy 
programs collaborate on the development of identification and authentication policy and 
procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are 
preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and 
procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be 
represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can 
be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for 
systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can 
be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be 
documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events 
that may precipitate an update to identification and authentication policy and procedures 
include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable 
laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply 
restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

IA-2,"IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION: (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) 
 Control:  Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique 
identification with processes acting on behalf of those users. 
Discussion:  Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements by 
complying with the requirements in [HSPD 12]. Organizational users include employees or 
individuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g., 
contractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to 
all accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in"
AC-14,"and that occur through the 
authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication: . Since processes 
execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of 
individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity. 
Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user 
identities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to 
organizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any 
access to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is 
obtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to 
organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained 
through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access 
that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area 
networks and wide area networks. 
The use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-
controlled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal 
networks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing 
the network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users are 
described in IA-8

Control Enhancements: 
(1) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR 
AUTHENTICATION TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS  
Implement multi-factor authentication for access to privileged accounts. 
Discussion:  Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to 
achieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you 
know (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical 
authenticator such as a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric). 
Multi-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware 
authenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such 
as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or the Department of 
Defense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC). In addition to authenticating users at the system 
level (i.e., at logon), organizations may employ authentication mechanisms at the application 
level, at their discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e., 
local, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options 
appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security measures, such as 
additional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.

Control: :  Uniquely identify and authenticate [Assignment: organization-defined devices and/or 
types of devices] before establishing a [Selection (one or more): local; remote; network] 
connection. 
Discussion:  Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication are 
defined by type, device, or a combination of type and device. Organization-defined device types 
include devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use shared known information 
(e.g., Media Access Control [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] 
addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], 
RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and 
authenticate devices on local and wide area networks. Organizations determine the required 
strength of authentication mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and mission 
or business requirements. Because of the challenges of implementing device authentication on a 
large scale, organizations can restrict the application of the control to a limited number/type of 
devices based on mission or business needs.

Discussion:  A local connection is a connection with a device that communicates without the 
use of a network. A network connection is a connection with a device that communicates 
through a network. A remote connection is a connection with a device that communicates

IA-5,"AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT 
 Control: :  Manage system authenticators by: 
a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, 
group, role, service, or device receiving the authenticator; 
b. Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the organization; 
c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use; 
d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator 
distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking 
authenticators; 
e. Changing default authenticators prior to first use; 
f. Changing or refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by 
authenticator type] or when [Assignment: organization-defined events] occur; 
g. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification; 
h. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific controls to protect 
authenticators; and 
i. Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those accounts 
changes. 
Discussion:  Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics, certificates, 
one-time password devices, and ID badges. Device authenticators include certificates and 
passwords. Initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial 
password). In contrast, the requirements for authenticator content contain specific criteria or 
characteristics (e.g., minimum password length). Developers may deliver system components 
with factory default authentication credentials (i.e., passwords) to allow for initial installation 
and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, 
and present a significant risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be 
implemented via control"

IA-6,"AUTHENTICATION FEEDBACK 
Control: :  Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to 
protect the information from possible exploitation and use by unauthorized individuals. 
Discussion:  Authentication feedback from systems does not provide information that would 
allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of 
systems, such as desktops or notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (referred to as 
shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems, such as mobile devices with 
small displays, the threat may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood 
of typographic input errors due to small keyboards. Thus, the means for obscuring authentication 
feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring authentication feedback includes displaying asterisks 
when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time 
before obscuring it.

applications.  
Discussion:  Services that may require identification and authentication include web applications 
using digital certificates or services or applications that query a database. Identification and 
authentication methods for system services and applications include information or code signing, 
provenance graphs, and electronic signatures that indicate the sources of services. Decisions 
regarding the validity of identification and authentication claims can be made by services 
separate from the services acting on those decisions. This can occur in distributed system 
architectures. In such situations, the identification and authentication decisions (instead of actual 
identifiers and authentication data) are provided to the services that need to act on those 
decisions.

Control: :  Require individuals accessing the system to employ [Assignment: organization-defined 
supplemental authentication techniques or mechanisms] under specific [Assignment: 
organization-defined circumstances or situations].  
Discussion:  Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms employed by 
organizations and subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. To address this threat, 
organizations may employ specific techniques or mechanisms and establish protocols to assess 
suspicious behavior. Suspicious behavior may include accessing information that individuals do 
not typically access as part of their duties, roles, or responsibilities; accessing greater quantities 
of information than individuals would routinely access; or attempting to access information from 
suspicious network addresses. When pre-established conditions or triggers occur, organizations 
can require individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use 
for adaptive authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the number or 
types of records being accessed. Adaptive authentication does not replace and is not used to 
avoid the use of multi-factor authentication mechanisms but can augment implementations of 
multi-factor authentication.

1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business process-level; System-
level] incident response policy that: 
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the incident response policy and the 
associated incident response controls; 
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, 
documentation, and dissemination of the incident response policy and procedures; and 
c. Review and update the current incident response: 
1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]; and 
2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Incident response policy and procedures address the controls in the IR family that 
are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an 
important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute 
to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs 
collaborate on the development of incident response policy and procedures. Security and privacy 
program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may 
obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be 
included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies 
that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and 
privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures 
describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or 
role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and 
privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to 
incident response policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents 
or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and 
guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

 Control: : 
a. Provide incident response training to system users consistent with assigned roles and 
responsibilities: 
1. Within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of assuming an incident response 
role or responsibility or acquiring system access; 
2. When required by system changes; and 
3. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter; and 
b. Review and update incident response training content [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities 
of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are 
included in such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to 
recognize an incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle 
incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, data 
collection techniques, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response 
training includes user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and 
internal sources. Incident response training for users may be provided as part of"
AT-2,"or AT: -3. 
Events that may precipitate an update to incident response training content include, but are not 
limited to, incident response plan testing or response to an actual incident (lessons learned), 
assessment or audit findings, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, 
regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

Discussion:  Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine their effectiveness 
and identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes the use of 
checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, and simulations (parallel or full interrupt). Incident 
response testing can include a determination of the effects on organizational operations and 
assets and individuals due to incident response. The use of qualitative and quantitative data aids 
in determining the effectiveness of incident response processes.

IR-4,"INCIDENT HANDLING 
Control: : 
a. Implement an incident handling capability for incidents that is consistent with the incident 
response plan and includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication,

c. Incorporate lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response 
procedures, training, and testing, and implement the resulting changes accordingly; and 
d. Ensure the rigor, intensity, scope, and results of incident handling activities are comparable 
and predictable across the organization. 
Discussion:  Organizations recognize that incident response capabilities are dependent on the 
capabilities of organizational systems and the mission and business processes being supported by 
those systems. Organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and 
development of mission and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can 
be obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring, 
and network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply chain events. An 
effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities 
(e.g., mission or business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, 
physical security offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function], 
operations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of 
suspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain 
incidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational 
systems or system components. For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally 
identifiable information is considered a breach. A breach results in unauthorized disclosure, the 
loss of control, unauthorized acquisition, compromise, or a similar occurrence where a person 
other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable 
information or an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses such information for other 
than authorized purposes.

or diagnostic services; sanitize the component (for organizational information); and 
after the service is performed, inspect and sanitize the component (for potentially 
malicious software) before reconnecting the component to the system. 
Discussion:  Comparable security capability on systems, diagnostic tools, and equipment 
providing maintenance services implies that the implemented controls on those systems, 
tools, and equipment are at least as comprehensive as the controls on the system being 
serviced.

a. Establish a process for maintenance personnel authorization and maintain a list of 
authorized maintenance organizations or personnel; 
b. Verify that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance on the system possess the 
required access authorizations; and 
c. Designate organizational personnel with required access authorizations and technical 
competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the 
required access authorizations.  
Discussion:  Maintenance personnel refers to individuals who perform hardware or software 
maintenance on organizational systems, while"
PE-2,"addresses physical access for individuals 
whose maintenance duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the systems: . 
Technical competence of supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the 
systems, while having required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the 
systems. Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel—such as 
information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and consultants—may 
require privileged access to organizational systems, such as when they are required to conduct 
maintenance activities with little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, 
organizations may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may 
be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.

MA-6,"TIMELY MAINTENANCE 
 Control: :  Obtain maintenance support and/or spare parts for [Assignment: organization-defined 
system components] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of failure. 
Discussion:  Organizations specify the system components that result in increased risk to 
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation when the 
functionality provided by those components is not operational. Organizational actions to obtain 
maintenance support include having appropriate contracts in place. 
Related Controls:  CM-8, CP-2, CP-7, RA-7, SA-15, SI-13, SR-2, SR-3, SR-4. 
Control Enhancements: 
(1) TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE 
Perform preventive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined system 
components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals]. 
Discussion:  Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and the servicing of system 
components to maintain organizational equipment and facilities in satisfactory operating 
condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic inspection, tests, measurements, 
adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before 
they occur or before they develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive 
maintenance is to avoid or mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive 
maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn 
components before they fail. Methods of determining what preventive (or other) failure 
management policies to apply include original equipment manufacturer recommendations; 
statistical failure records; expert opinion; maintenance that has already been conducted on 
similar equipment; requirements of codes, laws, or regulations within a jurisdiction; or 
measured values and performance indications. 
Related Controls:  None. 
(2) TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE 
Perform predictive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined system 
components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals]. 
Discussion:  Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing 
periodic or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive 
maintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled time when the maintenance activity 
is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. The 
predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the objective of predicting the 
future trend of the equipment's condition. The predictive maintenance approach employs 
principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance 
activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while 
equipment is in service, thus minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Predictive 
maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability. 
Related Controls:  None."
MA-7,"FIELD MAINTENANCE 
 Control: :  Restrict or prohibit field maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined systems or 
system components] to [Assignment: organization-defined trusted maintenance facilities]. 
Discussion:  Field maintenance is the type of maintenance conducted on a system or system 
component after the system or component has been deployed to a specific site (i.e., operational 
environment). In certain instances, field maintenance (i.e., local maintenance at the site) may not 
be executed with the same degree of rigor or with the same quality control checks as depot 
maintenance. For critical systems designated as such by the organization, it may be necessary to 
restrict or prohibit field maintenance at the local site and require that such maintenance be 
conducted in trusted facilities with additional controls.

MP-1,"POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Control: : 
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]: 
1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business process-level; System-
level] media protection policy that: 
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the media protection policy and the 
associated media protection controls; 
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, 
documentation, and dissemination of the media protection policy and procedures; and 
c. Review and update the current media protection: 
1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]; and 
2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Media protection policy and procedures address the controls in the MP family that 
are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an 
important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute 
to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs 
collaborate on the development of media protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy 
program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may 
obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be 
included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies 
that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and 
privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures 
describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or 
role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and 
privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to 
media protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents 
or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy 
or procedure.

MP-2,"MEDIA ACCESS 
Control: :  Restrict access to [Assignment: organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital 
media] to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]. 
Discussion:  System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes flash 
drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state, 
magnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and 
microfilm. Denying access to patient medical records in a community hospital unless the 
individuals seeking access to such records are authorized healthcare providers is an example of 
restricting access to non-digital media. Limiting access to the design specifications stored on 
compact discs in the media library to individuals on the system development team is an example 
of restricting access to digital media.

security markings (if any) of the information; and 
b. Exempt [Assignment: organization-defined types of system media] from marking if the media 
remain within [Assignment: organization-defined controlled areas].   
Discussion:  Security marking refers to the application or use of human-readable security 
attributes. Digital media includes diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk 
drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), flash drives, compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-
digital media includes paper and microfilm. Controlled unclassified information is defined by the 
National Archives and Records Administration along with the appropriate safeguarding and 
dissemination requirements for such information and is codified in [32 CFR 2002]. Security 
markings are generally not required for media that contains information determined by 
organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. Some organizations may 
require markings for public information indicating that the information is publicly releasable. 
System media marking reflects applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, 
standards, and guidelines.

MP-6,"MEDIA SANITIZATION 
Control: : 
a. Sanitize [Assignment: organization-defined system media] prior to disposal, release out of 
organizational control, or release for reuse using [Assignment: organization-defined 
sanitization techniques and procedures]; and 
b. Employ sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the 
security category or classification of the information. 
Discussion:   Media sanitization applies to all digital and non-digital system media subject to 
disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include digital 
media in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, 
mobile devices, and non-digital media (e.g., paper and microfilm). The sanitization process 
removes information from system media such that the information cannot be retrieved or 
reconstructed. Sanitization techniques—including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, de-
identification of personally identifiable information, and destruction—prevent the disclosure of 
information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. 
Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction is 
sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization."
MP-7,"MEDIA USE 
Control: : 
a. [Selection: Restrict; Prohibit] the use of [Assignment: organization-defined types of system 
media] on [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components] using 
[Assignment: organization-defined controls]; and 
b. Prohibit the use of portable storage devices in organizational systems when such devices 
have no identifiable owner. 
Discussion:  System media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes 
diskettes, magnetic tapes, flash drives, compact discs, digital versatile discs, and removable hard 
disk drives. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Media use protections also apply to 
mobile devices with information storage capabilities. In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user 
access to media,"
MP-7,"restricts the use of certain types of media on systems: , for example, 
restricting or prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations use 
technical and nontechnical controls to restrict the use of system media. Organizations may 
restrict the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations 
to prohibit access to certain external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read, or"
MP-8,"MEDIA DOWNGRADING 
Control: : 
a. Establish [Assignment: organization-defined system media downgrading process] that 
includes employing downgrading mechanisms with strength and integrity commensurate 
with the security category or classification of the information; 
b. Verify that the system media downgrading process is commensurate with the security 
category and/or classification level of the information to be removed and the access 
authorizations of the potential recipients of the downgraded information; 
c. Identify [Assignment: organization-defined system media requiring downgrading]; and 
d. Downgrade the identified system media using the established process. 
Discussion:  Media downgrading applies to digital and non-digital media subject to release 
outside of the organization, whether the media is considered removable or not. When applied to 
system media, the downgrading process removes information from the media, typically by 
security category or classification level, such that the information cannot be retrieved or 
reconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable wider release 
and distribution. Downgrading ensures that empty space on the media is devoid of information. 
Related Controls:  None.

Control: :  Provide an uninterruptible power supply to facilitate [Selection (one or more): an 
orderly shutdown of the system; transition of the system to long-term alternate power] in the 
event of a primary power source loss. 
Discussion:  An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or mechanism that 
provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main power source. A UPS is typically 
used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical 
equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious 
mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency 
power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from 
unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in 
batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but 
provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly 
shut down the system.

independent energy source. 
Discussion:  The provision of fire detection and suppression systems applies primarily to 
organizational facilities that contain concentrations of system resources, including data centers, 
server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Fire detection and suppression systems that may 
require an independent energy source include sprinkler systems and smoke detectors. An 
independent energy source is an energy source, such as a microgrid, that is separate, or can be

readily available alternate locations during contingency operations. Organizations can define 
different sets of controls for specific alternate work sites or types of sites depending on the 
work-related activities conducted at the sites. Implementing and assessing the effectiveness of 
organization-defined controls and providing a means to communicate incidents at alternate work

Discussion:  Planning policy and procedures for the controls in the PL family implemented within 
systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing 
such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy 
assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on their 
development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are 
preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system-specific policies and 
procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be 
represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can 
be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for 
systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can 
be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be 
documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events 
that may precipitate an update to planning policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, 
assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, 
directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not 
constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

d. Update the plans to address changes to the system and environment of operation or 
problems identified during plan implementation or control assessments; and 
e. Protect the plans from unauthorized disclosure and modification. 
Discussion:  System security and privacy plans are scoped to the system and system components 
within the defined authorization boundary and contain an overview of the security and privacy 
requirements for the system and the controls selected to satisfy the requirements. The plans 
describe the intended application of each selected control in the context of the system with a 
sufficient level of detail to correctly implement the control and to subsequently assess the 
effectiveness of the control. The control documentation describes how system-specific and 
hybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of 
the system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development of 
systems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy engineering processes. System security 
and privacy plans are living documents that are updated and adapted throughout the system 
development life cycle (e.g., during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for 
proposal, and design reviews).

PL-4,"RULES OF BEHAVIOR 
 Control: : 
a. Establish and provide to individuals requiring access to the system, the rules that describe 
their responsibilities and expected behavior for information and system usage, security, and 
privacy; 
b. Receive a documented acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that they have 
read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to 
information and the system; 
c. Review and update the rules of behavior [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and 
d. Require individuals who have acknowledged a previous version of the rules of behavior to 
read and re-acknowledge [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined 
frequency]; when the rules are revised or updated]. 
Discussion:  Rules of behavior represent a type of access agreement for organizational users. 
Other types of access agreements include nondisclosure agreements, conflict-of-interest 
agreements, and acceptable use agreements (see PS-6). Organizations consider rules of behavior 
based on individual user roles and responsibilities and differentiate between rules that apply to 
privileged users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules of behavior for some 
types of non-organizational users, including individuals who receive information from federal 
systems, is often not feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their 
interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior for organizational and non-organizational users 
can also be established in 
AC-8. The related controls section provides a list of controls that are 
relevant to organizational rules of behavior. PL-4b, the documented acknowledgment portion of 
the control, may be satisfied by the literacy training and awareness and role-based training 
programs conducted by organizations if such training includes rules of behavior. Documented 
acknowledgements for rules of behavior include electronic or physical signatures and electronic 
agreement check boxes or radio buttons.

secrets (e.g., passwords) for creating accounts on external sites/applications. 
Discussion:  Social media, social networking, and external site/application usage restrictions 
address rules of behavior related to the use of social media, social networking, and external 
sites when organizational personnel are using such sites for official duties or in the conduct 
of official business, when organizational information is involved in social media and social 
networking transactions, and when personnel access social media and networking sites from 
organizational systems. Organizations also address specific rules that prevent unauthorized 
entities from obtaining non-public organizational information from social media and 
networking sites either directly or through inference. Non-public information includes 
personally identifiable information and system account information.

organization-wide security and privacy architectures described in PM-7, which are integral to and 
developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The architectures include an architectural 
description, the allocation of security and privacy functionality (including controls), security- and

(1) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARCHITECTURES | DEFENSE IN DEPTH  
Design the security and privacy architectures for the system using a defense-in-depth 
approach that: 
(a) Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined controls] to [Assignment: organization-
defined locations and architectural layers]; and 
(b) Ensures that the allocated controls operate in a coordinated and mutually reinforcing 
manner. 
Discussion:  Organizations strategically allocate security and privacy controls in the security 
and privacy architectures so that adversaries must overcome multiple controls to achieve 
their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple controls makes it more difficult to 
attack information resources by increasing the work factor of the adversary; it also increases 
the likelihood of detection. The coordination of allocated controls is essential to ensure that 
an attack that involves one control does not create adverse, unintended consequences by 
interfering with other controls. Unintended consequences can include system lockout and"
PL-9,"CENTRAL MANAGEMENT 
 Control: :  Centrally manage [Assignment: organization-defined controls and related processes]. 
Discussion:  Central management refers to organization-wide management and implementation 
of selected controls and processes. This includes planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, 
and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed controls and processes. As the 
central management of controls is generally associated with the concept of common (inherited) 
controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of control implementations 
and management and the judicious use of organizational resources. Centrally managed controls 
and processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of initial 
and ongoing authorizations to operate and as part of organizational continuous monitoring. 
Automated tools (e.g., security information and event management tools or enterprise security 
monitoring and management tools) can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of 
information associated with centrally managed controls and processes. Automation can also 
provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities; alerting mechanisms; and dashboards 
to support risk-based decision-making within the organization. 
As part of the control selection processes, organizations determine the controls that may be 
suitable for central management based on resources and capabilities. It is not always possible to 
centrally manage every aspect of a control. In such cases, the control can be treated as a hybrid 
control with the control managed and implemented centrally or at the system level. The controls 
and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial central management include but 
are not limited to: AC-2(1), AC-2(2), AC-2(3), AC-2(4), AC-4(all), AC-17(1), AC-17(2), AC-17(3),

PL-10,"BASELINE SELECTION 
 Control: :  Select a control baseline for the system. 
Discussion:  Control baselines are predefined sets of controls specifically assembled to address 
the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of interest. Controls are chosen for 
baselines to either satisfy mandates imposed by laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, 
policies, standards, and guidelines or address threats common to all users of the baseline under 
the assumptions specific to the baseline. Baselines represent a starting point for the protection 
of individuals’ privacy, information, and information systems with subsequent tailoring actions to 
manage risk in accordance with mission, business, or other constraints (see PL-11). Federal 
control baselines are provided in [SP 800-53B]. The selection of a control baseline is determined 
by the needs of stakeholders. Stakeholder needs consider mission and business requirements as 
well as mandates imposed by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, 
standards, and guidelines. For example, the control baselines in [SP 800-53B] are based on the 
requirements from [FISMA] and [PRIVACT]. The requirements, along with the NIST standards and 
guidelines implementing the legislation, direct organizations to select one of the control 
baselines after the reviewing the information types and the information that is processed, 
stored, and transmitted on the system; analyzing the potential adverse impact of the loss or 
compromise of the information or system on the organization’s operations and assets, 
individuals, other organizations, or the Nation; and considering the results from system and 
organizational risk assessments. [CNSSI 1253] provides guidance on control baselines for national 
security systems.

PL-11,"BASELINE TAILORING 
 Control: :  Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring actions.  
Discussion:  The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize a set of 
baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. Tailoring actions facilitate such 
specialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security and privacy plans 
that reflect their specific mission and business functions, the environments where their systems 
operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other conditions or 
situations that can impact their mission or business success. Tailoring guidance is provided in [
SP 
800-53B]. Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common 
controls, applying scoping considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning values to 
control parameters, supplementing the control baseline with additional controls as needed, and 
providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in [SP 800-53B] 
can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring 
actions can be applied to the baselines in [SP 800-53B] in accordance with the security and 
privacy requirements from [FISMA], [PRIVACT], and [OMB A-130]. Alternatively, other 
communities of interest adopting different control baselines can apply the tailoring actions in [SP

of those entities."

Discussion:  An information security program plan is a formal document that provides an 
overview of the security requirements for an organization-wide information security program 
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONTROLS  
[FISMA], [ PRIVACT], and [ OMB A -130] require federal agencies to develop, implement, and 
provide oversight for organization-wide information security and privacy p rograms to help 
ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information processed, stored, 
and transmitted by federal information systems and to protect individual privacy. The program 
management (PM) controls described in this section are implemented at the organization level 
and not direct ed at individual information  systems. The PM  controls have been designed to 
facilitate organizational compliance with applicable federal laws, e xecutive orders, directives, 
policies, regulations, and standards. The controls are independent of [ FIPS 200] impact levels 
and, therefore, are not associated with the control baselines described in [SP 800-53B]. 
Organizations document program management controls in the information security and privacy 
program plans. The organization-wide information security program plan (see PM-1) and privacy 
program plan (see PM-18) supplement system security and privacy plans (see PL-2) developed 
for organizational information systems. Together, the system security and privacy plans for the 
individual information systems and the information security and privacy program  plans cover 
the totality of security and privacy controls employed by the organization."
PM-18,"and SR: -2, respectively. 
An information security program plan documents implementation details about program 
management and common controls. The plan provides sufficient information about the controls 
(including specification of parameters for assignment and selection operations, explicitly or by 
reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the 
plan and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plan is implemented as intended. 
Updates to information security program plans include organizational changes and problems 
identified during plan implementation or control assessments. 
Program management controls may be implemented at the organization level or the mission or 
business process level, and are essential for managing the organization’s information security 
program. Program management controls are distinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid 
controls because program management controls are independent of any particular system. 
Together, the individual system security plans and the organization-wide information security 
program plan provide complete coverage for the security controls employed within the 
organization. 
Common controls available for inheritance by organizational systems are documented in an 
appendix to the organization’s information security program plan unless the controls are 
included in a separate security plan for a system. The organization-wide information security 
program plan indicates which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls. 
Events that may precipitate an update to the information security program plan include, but are 
not limited to, organization-wide assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or 
changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

systems: 
1. Are developed and maintained; 
2. Document the remedial information security, privacy, and supply chain risk 
management actions to adequately respond to risk to organizational operations and 
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and 
3. Are reported in accordance with established reporting requirements. 
b. Review plans of action and milestones for consistency with the organizational risk 
management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions. 
Discussion:  The plan of action and milestones is a key organizational document and is subject to 
reporting requirements established by the Office of Management and Budget. Organizations 
develop plans of action and milestones with an organization-wide perspective, prioritizing risk 
response actions and ensuring consistency with the goals and objectives of the organization. Plan 
of action and milestones updates are based on findings from control assessments and continuous 
monitoring activities. There can be multiple plans of action and milestones corresponding to the 
information system level, mission/business process level, and organizational/governance level. 
While plans of action and milestones are required for federal organizations, other types of 
organizations can help reduce risk by documenting and tracking planned remediations. Specific 
guidance on plans of action and milestones at the system level is provided in 
CA-5.

(1) SYSTEM INVENTORY | INVENTORY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 
Establish, maintain, and update [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] an 
inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process personally identifiable 
information. 
Discussion:  An inventory of systems, applications, and projects that process personally 
identifiable information supports the mapping of data actions, providing individuals with 
privacy notices, maintaining accurate personally identifiable information, and limiting the 
processing of personally identifiable information when such information is not needed for 
operational purposes. Organizations may use this inventory to ensure that systems only 
process the personally identifiable information for authorized purposes and that this 
processing is still relevant and necessary for the purpose specified therein.

Control: :  Develop and maintain an enterprise architecture with consideration for information 
security, privacy, and the resulting risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and the Nation.  
Discussion:  The integration of security and privacy requirements and controls into the enterprise 
architecture helps to ensure that security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout 
the system development life cycle and are explicitly related to the organization’s mission and 
business processes. The process of security and privacy requirements integration also embeds 
into the enterprise architecture and the organization’s security and privacy architectures 
consistent with the organizational risk management strategy. For PM-7, security and privacy 
architectures are developed at a system-of-systems level, representing all organizational"
PM-8,"CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN  
Control: :  Address information security and privacy issues in the development, documentation, 
and updating of a critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan.  
Discussion:  Protection strategies are based on the prioritization of critical assets and resources.

which those systems operate through authorization processes; 
b. Designate individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities within the organizational risk 
management process; and 
c. Integrate the authorization processes into an organization-wide risk management program. 
Discussion:  Authorization processes for organizational systems and environments of operation 
require the implementation of an organization-wide risk management process and associated 
security and privacy standards and guidelines. Specific roles for risk management processes 
include a risk executive (function) and designated authorizing officials for each organizational 
system and common control provider. The authorization processes for the organization are 
integrated with continuous monitoring processes to facilitate ongoing understanding and 
acceptance of security and privacy risks to organizational operations, organizational assets, 
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and 
b. Determine information protection and personally identifiable information processing needs 
arising from the defined mission and business processes; and"
PM-12,"INSIDER THREAT PROGRAM 
 Control: :  Implement an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat 
incident handling team. 
Discussion:  Organizations that handle classified information are required, under Executive Order 
13587 [EO 13587] and the National Insider Threat Policy [ODNI NITP], to establish insider threat 
programs. The same standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified 
environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified 
and other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include controls 
to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis 
of both technical and nontechnical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A 
senior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to 
implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and 
analysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations to prepare department or 
agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of 
individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat 
awareness training to employees, receive access to information from offices in the department 
or agency for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department or agency 
insider threat posture. 
Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations 
may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources 
records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some 
types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace, including 
ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues. 
These precursors can guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. 
However, the use of human resource records could raise significant concerns for privacy. The"
PM-13,"SECURITY AND PRIVACY WORKFORCE 
 Control: :  Establish a security and privacy workforce development and improvement program. 
Discussion:  Security and privacy workforce development and improvement programs include 
defining the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform security and privacy duties and 
tasks; developing role-based training programs for individuals assigned security and privacy roles 
and responsibilities; and providing standards and guidelines for measuring and building individual 
qualifications for incumbents and applicants for security- and privacy-related positions. Such 
workforce development and improvement programs can also include security and privacy career 
paths to encourage security and privacy professionals to advance in the field and fill positions 
with greater responsibility. The programs encourage organizations to fill security- and privacy-
related positions with qualified personnel. Security and privacy workforce development and 
improvement programs are complementary to organizational security awareness and training 
programs and focus on developing and institutionalizing the core security and privacy capabilities 
of personnel needed to protect organizational operations, assets, and individuals.

PM-14,"TESTING: , TRAINING, AND MONITORING  
Control: 
a. Implement a process for ensuring that organizational plans for conducting security and 
privacy testing, training, and monitoring activities associated with organizational systems: 
1. Are developed and maintained; and 
2. Continue to be executed; and 
b. Review testing, training, and monitoring plans for consistency with the organizational risk 
management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions. 
Discussion:  A process for organization-wide security and privacy testing, training, and monitoring 
helps ensure that organizations provide oversight for testing, training, and monitoring activities 
and that those activities are coordinated. With the growing importance of continuous monitoring 
programs, the implementation of information security and privacy across the three levels of the 
risk management hierarchy and the widespread use of common controls, organizations 
coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring activities that are routinely conducted as 
part of ongoing assessments supporting a variety of controls. Security and privacy training 
activities, while focused on individual systems and specific roles, require coordination across all 
organizational elements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and activities are informed by 
current threat and vulnerability assessments. 
Related Controls:  AT-2, AT-3, CA-7, CP-4, IR-3, PM-12, SI-4."
PM-15,"SECURITY AND PRIVACY GROUPS AND ASSOCIATIONS 
Control: :  Establish and institutionalize contact with selected groups and associations within the 
security and privacy communities: 
a. To facilitate ongoing security and privacy education and training for organizational 
personnel; 
b. To maintain currency with recommended security and privacy practices, techniques, and 
technologies; and 
c. To share current security and privacy information, including threats, vulnerabilities, and 
incidents. 
Discussion:  Ongoing contact with security and privacy groups and associations is important in an 
environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Groups and associations include 
special interest groups, professional associations, forums, news groups, users’ groups, and peer 
groups of security and privacy professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select security 
and privacy groups and associations based on mission and business functions. Organizations 
share threat, vulnerability, and incident information as well as contextual insights, compliance 
techniques, and privacy problems consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, 
policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.

PM-16,"THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM 
 Control: :  Implement a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization information-
sharing capability for threat intelligence. 
Discussion:  Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries, 
especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it may be more likely that adversaries can 
successfully breach or compromise organizational systems. One of the best techniques to 
address this concern is for organizations to share threat information, including threat events (i.e., 
tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that 
organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence 
(i.e., indications and warnings about threats). Threat information sharing may be bilateral or 
multilateral. Bilateral threat sharing includes government-to-commercial and government-to-
government cooperatives. Multilateral threat sharing includes organizations taking part in threat-
sharing consortia. Threat information may require special agreements and protection, or it may 
be freely shared.

b. Correcting or deleting inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable information; 
c. Disseminating notice of corrected or deleted personally identifiable information to 
individuals or other appropriate entities; and 
d. Appeals of adverse decisions on correction or deletion requests. 
Discussion:  Personally identifiable information quality management includes steps that 
organizations take to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally identifiable information 
throughout the information life cycle. The information life cycle includes the creation, collection, 
use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposition of personally 
identifiable information. Organizational policies and procedures for personally identifiable 
information quality management are important because inaccurate or outdated personally 
identifiable information maintained by organizations may cause problems for individuals. 
Organizations consider the quality of personally identifiable information involved in business 
functions where inaccurate information may result in adverse decisions or the denial of benefits 
and services, or the disclosure of the information may cause stigmatization. Correct information, 
in certain circumstances, can cause problems for individuals that outweigh the benefits of 
organizations maintaining the information. Organizations consider creating policies and 
procedures for the removal of such information.  
The senior agency official for privacy ensures that practical means and mechanisms exist and are 
accessible for individuals or their authorized representatives to seek the correction or deletion of 
personally identifiable information. Processes for correcting or deleting data are clearly defined 
and publicly available. Organizations use discretion in determining whether data is to be deleted 
or corrected based on the scope of requests, the changes sought, and the impact of the changes. 
Additionally, processes include the provision of responses to individuals of decisions to deny

transparency in organizational privacy operations. Reporting can also help organizations to 
determine progress in meeting privacy compliance requirements and privacy controls, compare 
performance across the federal government, discover vulnerabilities, identify gaps in policy and 
implementation, and identify models for success. For federal agencies, privacy reports include 
annual senior agency official for privacy reports to OMB, reports to Congress required by 
Implementing Regulations of the 9/11 Commission Act, and other public reports required by law,

system owners. The assumptions, constraints, risk tolerance, priorities, and trade-offs identified 
as part of the risk framing process inform the risk management strategy, which in turn informs 
the conduct of risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring activities. Risk framing results 
are shared with organizational personnel, including mission and business owners, information"

PM-30,"SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY 
Control: : 
a. Develop an organization-wide strategy for managing supply chain risks associated with the 
development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems, system components, and 
system services; 
b. Implement the supply chain risk management strategy consistently across the organization; 
and 
c. Review and update the supply chain risk management strategy on [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes. 
Discussion:  An organization-wide supply chain risk management strategy includes an 
unambiguous expression of the supply chain risk appetite and tolerance for the organization, 
acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently 
evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating 
the supply chain risk management strategy, and the associated roles and responsibilities. Supply 
chain risk management includes considerations of the security and privacy risks associated with 
the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems, system components, and 
system services. The supply chain risk management strategy can be incorporated into the 
organization’s overarching risk management strategy and can guide and inform supply chain 
policies and system-level supply chain risk management plans. In addition, the use of a risk 
executive function can facilitate a consistent, organization-wide application of the supply chain 
risk management strategy. The supply chain risk management strategy is implemented at the 
organization and mission/business levels, whereas the supply chain risk management plan (see 
SR-2) is implemented at the system level.

PM-31,"CONTINUOUS MONITORING STRATEGY 
 Control: :  Develop an organization-wide continuous monitoring strategy and implement 
continuous monitoring programs that include: 
a. Establishing the following organization-wide metrics to be monitored: [Assignment: 
organization-defined metrics]; 
b. Establishing [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for monitoring and 
[Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for assessment of control effectiveness; 
c. Ongoing monitoring of organizationally-defined metrics in accordance with the continuous 
monitoring strategy; 
d. Correlation and analysis of information generated by control assessments and monitoring; 
e. Response actions to address results of the analysis of control assessment and monitoring 
information; and 
f. Reporting the security and privacy status of organizational systems to [Assignment: 
organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Discussion:  Continuous monitoring at the organization level facilitates ongoing awareness of the 
security and privacy posture across the organization to support organizational risk management 
decisions. The terms “continuous” and “ongoing” imply that organizations assess and monitor 
their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types 
of controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring 
guide and inform risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs allow 
organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic 
environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, 
and technologies. Having access to security- and privacy-related information on a continuing 
basis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make 
effective, timely, and informed risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization 
decisions. To further facilitate security and privacy risk management, organizations consider 
aligning organization-defined monitoring metrics with organizational risk tolerance as defined in 
the risk management strategy. Monitoring requirements, including the need for monitoring, may 
be referenced in other controls and control enhancements such as, AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a),

PM-32,"PURPOSING 
Control: :  Analyze [Assignment: organization-defined systems or systems components] supporting 
mission essential services or functions to ensure that the information resources are being used 
consistent with their intended purpose. 
Discussion:  Systems are designed to support a specific mission or business function. However, 
over time, systems and system components may be used to support services and functions that 
are outside of the scope of the intended mission or business functions. This can result in 
exposing information resources to unintended environments and uses that can significantly 
increase threat exposure. In doing so, the systems are more vulnerable to compromise, which 
can ultimately impact the services and functions for which they were intended. This is especially 
impactful for mission-essential services and functions. By analyzing resource use, organizations 
can identify such potential exposures.

(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the personnel security policy and the 
associated personnel security controls; 
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, 
documentation, and dissemination of the personnel security policy and procedures; and 
c. Review and update the current personnel security: 
1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]; and 
2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Personnel security policy and procedures for the controls in the PS family that are 
implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important 
factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security 
and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate 
on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization 
level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system-specific 
policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy 
policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. 
Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, 
and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented 
and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can 
be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. 
Events that may precipitate an update to personnel security policy and procedures include, but 
are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in 
applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. 
Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

 Control: : 
a. Assign a risk designation to all organizational positions; 
b. Establish screening criteria for individuals filling those positions; and 
c. Review and update position risk designations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 
Discussion:  Position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management (OPM) policy and 
guidance. Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent suitability 
and personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and 
responsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or 
integrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and establishes the risk 
level of that position. The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of 
the position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse 
effect on national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the 
sensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of investigation 
is conducted for a position. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations 
that individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems. 
Position screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements. 
Parts 1400 and 731 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, establish the requirements for 
organizations to evaluate relevant covered positions for a position sensitivity and position risk 
designation commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of those positions.

Discussion:  Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable laws, executive 
orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, and specific criteria established for 
the risk designations of assigned positions. Examples of personnel screening include background 
investigations and agency checks. Organizations may define different rescreening conditions and 
frequencies for personnel accessing systems based on types of information processed, stored, or

Discussion:  Personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and 
procedures address the controls in the PT family that are implemented within systems and 
organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies 
and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, 
it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of personally

PT-2,"AUTHORITY TO PROCESS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 
Control: :   
a. Determine and document the [Assignment: organization-defined authority] that permits the 
[Assignment: organization-defined processing] of personally identifiable information; and 
b. Restrict the [Assignment: organization-defined processing] of personally identifiable 
information to only that which is authorized. 
Discussion:  The processing of personally identifiable information is an operation or set of 
operations that the information system or organization performs with respect to personally 
identifiable information across the information life cycle. Processing includes but is not limited to 
creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and 
disposal. Processing operations also include logging, generation, and transformation, as well as 
analysis techniques, such as data mining.  
Organizations may be subject to laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that 
establish the organization’s authority and thereby limit certain types of processing of personally 
identifiable information or establish other requirements related to the processing. Organizational 
personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding such 
authority, particularly if the organization is subject to multiple jurisdictions or sources of 
authority. For organizations whose processing is not determined according to legal authorities, 
the organization’s policies and determinations govern how they process personally identifiable 
information. While processing of personally identifiable information may be legally permissible, 
privacy risks may still arise. Privacy risk assessments can identify the privacy risks associated with 
the authorized processing of personally identifiable information and support solutions to manage 
such risks.  
Organizations consider applicable requirements and organizational policies to determine how to 
document this authority. For federal agencies, the authority to process personally identifiable 
information is documented in privacy policies and notices, system of records notices, privacy 
impact assessments, [PRIVACT] statements, computer matching agreements and notices, 
contracts, information sharing agreements, memoranda of understanding, and other 
documentation. 
Organizations take steps to ensure that personally identifiable information is only processed for 
authorized purposes, including training organizational personnel on the authorized processing of 
personally identifiable information and monitoring and auditing organizational use of personally 
identifiable information.

a. Identify and document the [Assignment: organization-defined purpose(s)] for processing 
personally identifiable information; 
b. Describe the purpose(s) in the public privacy notices and policies of the organization;  
c. Restrict the [Assignment: organization-defined processing] of personally identifiable 
information to only that which is compatible with the identified purpose(s); and  
d. Monitor changes in processing personally identifiable information and implement 
[Assignment: organization-defined mechanisms] to ensure that any changes are made in 
accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined requirements]. 
Discussion:  Identifying and documenting the purpose for processing provides organizations with 
a basis for understanding why personally identifiable information may be processed. The term 
“process” includes every step of the information life cycle, including creation, collection, use, 
processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal. Identifying and 
documenting the purpose of processing is a prerequisite to enabling owners and operators of the 
system and individuals whose information is processed by the system to understand how the 
information will be processed. This enables individuals to make informed decisions about their 
engagement with information systems and organizations and to manage their privacy interests. 
Once the specific processing purpose has been identified, the purpose is described in the 
organization’s privacy notices, policies, and any related privacy compliance documentation, 
including privacy impact assessments, system of records notices, [
PRIVACT] statements, 
computer matching notices, and other applicable Federal Register notices. 
Organizations take steps to help ensure that personally identifiable information is processed only 
for identified purposes, including training organizational personnel and monitoring and auditing 
organizational processing of personally identifiable information. 
Organizations monitor for changes in personally identifiable information processing. 
Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel to 
ensure that any new purposes that arise from changes in processing are compatible with the 
purpose for which the information was collected, or if the new purpose is not compatible, 
implement mechanisms in accordance with defined requirements to allow for the new 
processing, if appropriate. Mechanisms may include obtaining consent from individuals, revising 
privacy policies, or other measures to manage privacy risks that arise from changes in personally 
identifiable information processing purposes.

PT-4,"CONSENT 
Control: :  Implement [Assignment: organization-defined tools or mechanisms] for individuals to

Discussion:  Consent allows individuals to participate in making decisions about the processing of 
their information and transfers some of the risk that arises from the processing of personally 
identifiable information from the organization to an individual. Consent may be required by 
applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines. 
Otherwise, when selecting consent as a control, organizations consider whether individuals can 
be reasonably expected to understand and accept the privacy risks that arise from their 
authorization. Organizations consider whether other controls may more effectively mitigate 
privacy risk either alone or in conjunction with consent. Organizations also consider any 
demographic or contextual factors that may influence the understanding or behavior of 
individuals with respect to the processing carried out by the system or organization. When 
soliciting consent from individuals, organizations consider the appropriate mechanism for 
obtaining consent, including the type of consent (e.g., opt-in, opt-out), how to properly 
authenticate and identity proof individuals and how to obtain consent through electronic means. 
In addition, organizations consider providing a mechanism for individuals to revoke consent once 
it has been provided, as appropriate. Finally, organizations consider usability factors to help 
individuals understand the risks being accepted when providing consent, including the use of 
plain language and avoiding technical jargon.

PT-6,"SYSTEM OF RECORDS NOTICE 
Control: :  For systems that process information that will be maintained in a Privacy Act system of

committees for advance review; 
b. Publish system of records notices in the Federal Register; and 
c. Keep system of records notices accurate, up-to-date, and scoped in accordance with policy. 
Discussion:  The [PRIVACT] requires that federal agencies publish a system of records notice in 
the Federal Register upon the establishment and/or modification of a [PRIVACT] system of 
records. As a general matter, a system of records notice is required when an agency maintains a 
group of any records under the control of the agency from which information is retrieved by the 
name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier. The notice 
describes the existence and character of the system and identifies the system of records, the 
purpose(s) of the system, the authority for maintenance of the records, the categories of records 
maintained in the system, the categories of individuals about whom records are maintained, the 
routine uses to which the records are subject, and additional details about the system as

Discussion:  A [PRIVACT] routine use is a particular kind of disclosure of a record outside of 
the federal agency maintaining the system of records. A routine use is an exception to the 
[PRIVACT] prohibition on the disclosure of a record in a system of records without the prior 
written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. To qualify as a routine use, 
the disclosure must be for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which the 
information was originally collected. The [
PRIVACT] requires agencies to describe each 
routine use of the records maintained in the system of records, including the categories of 
users of the records and the purpose of the use. Agencies may only establish routine uses by 
explicitly publishing them in the relevant system of records notice.

Discussion:  Organizations apply any conditions or protections that may be necessary for specific 
categories of personally identifiable information. These conditions may be required by laws, 
executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines. The requirements may 
also come from the results of privacy risk assessments that factor in contextual changes that may 
result in an organizational determination that a particular category of personally identifiable 
information is particularly sensitive or raises particular privacy risks. Organizations consult with 
the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding any protections that may be 
necessary.

PT-8,"COMPUTER MATCHING REQUIREMENTS 
Control: :  When a system or organization processes information for the purpose of conducting a

a. Obtain approval from the Data Integrity Board to conduct the matching program; 
b. Develop and enter into a computer matching agreement; 
c. Publish a matching notice in the Federal Register; 
d. Independently verify the information produced by the matching program before taking 
adverse action against an individual, if required; and 
e. Provide individuals with notice and an opportunity to contest the findings before taking 
adverse action against an individual. 
Discussion:  The [PRIVACT] establishes requirements for federal and non-federal agencies if they 
engage in a matching program. In general, a matching program is a computerized comparison of 
records from two or more automated [PRIVACT] systems of records or an automated system of 
records and automated records maintained by a non-federal agency (or agent thereof). A 
matching program either pertains to federal benefit programs or federal personnel or payroll 
records. A federal benefit match is performed to determine or verify eligibility for payments 
under federal benefit programs or to recoup payments or delinquent debts under federal benefit 
programs. A matching program involves not just the matching activity itself but also the 
investigative follow-up and ultimate action, if any.

a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]: 
1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business process-level; System-
level] risk assessment policy that: 
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the risk assessment policy and the 
associated risk assessment controls; 
b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the development, 
documentation, and dissemination of the risk assessment policy and procedures; and 
c. Review and update the current risk assessment: 
1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]; and 
2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: 
organization-defined events]. 
Discussion:  Risk assessment policy and procedures address the controls in the RA family that are 
implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important 
factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security 
and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate 
on the development of risk assessment policy and procedures. Security and privacy program 
policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the 
need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part 
of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the 
complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy 
programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe 
how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is 
the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans 
or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to risk assessment 
policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or 
changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. 
Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

RA-2,"SECURITY CATEGORIZATION  
Control: : 
a. Categorize the system and information it processes, stores, and transmits; 
b. Document the security categorization results, including supporting rationale, in the security 
plan for the system; and 
c. Verify that the authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative reviews 
and approves the security categorization decision. 
Discussion:  Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts or negative consequences 
to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals if organizational information 
and systems are compromised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Security 
categorization is also a type of asset loss characterization in systems security engineering 
processes that is carried out throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations can 
use privacy risk assessments or privacy impact assessments to better understand the potential 
adverse effects on individuals. [
CNSSI 1253] provides additional guidance on categorization for 
national security systems. 
Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an organization-wide activity with 
the direct involvement of chief information officers, senior agency information security officers, 
senior agency officials for privacy, system owners, mission and business owners, and information 
owners or stewards. Organizations consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations 
and, in accordance with [USA PATRIOT] and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential 
national-level adverse impacts. 
Security categorization processes facilitate the development of inventories of information assets 
and, along with CM-8, mappings to specific system components where information is processed, 
stored, or transmitted. The security categorization process is revisited throughout the system 
development life cycle to ensure that the security categories remain accurate and relevant.

Control Enhancements: 
(1) SECURITY CATEGORIZATION | IMPACT-LEVEL PRIORITIZATION 
Conduct an impact-level prioritization of organizational systems to obtain additional 
granularity on system impact levels. 
Discussion:  Organizations apply the “high-water mark” concept to each system categorized 
in accordance with [FIPS 199], resulting in systems designated as low impact, moderate 
impact, or high impact. Organizations that desire additional granularity in the system impact 
designations for risk-based decision-making, can further partition the systems into sub-
categories of the initial system categorization. For example, an impact-level prioritization on 
a moderate-impact system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate systems, 
moderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate systems. Impact-level prioritization and 
the resulting sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to focus their 
investments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control baselines in 
responding to identified risks. Impact-level prioritization can also be used to determine 
those systems that may be of heightened interest or value to adversaries or represent a 
critical loss to the federal enterprise, sometimes described as high value assets. For such 
high value assets, organizations may be more focused on complexity, aggregation, and 
information exchanges. Systems with high value assets can be prioritized by partitioning 
high-impact systems into low-high systems, moderate-high systems, and high-high systems."
RA-3,"RISK ASSESSMENT 
Control: : 
a. Conduct a risk assessment, including: 
1. Identifying threats to and vulnerabilities in the system; 
2. Determining the likelihood and magnitude of harm from unauthorized access, use, 
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the system, the information it 
processes, stores, or transmits, and any related information; and 
3. Determining the likelihood and impact of adverse effects on individuals arising from the 
processing of personally identifiable information; 
b. Integrate risk assessment results and risk management decisions from the organization and 
mission or business process perspectives with system-level risk assessments; 
c. Document risk assessment results in [Selection: security and privacy plans; risk assessment 
report; [Assignment: organization-defined document]]; 
d. Review risk assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
e. Disseminate risk assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 
roles]; and 
f. Update the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or when there are 
significant changes to the system, its environment of operation, or other conditions that may 
impact the security or privacy state of the system. 
Discussion:  Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to 
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Risk 
assessments also consider risk from external parties, including contractors who operate systems 
on behalf of the organization, individuals who access organizational systems, service providers, 
and outsourcing entities. 
Organizations can conduct risk assessments at all three levels in the risk management hierarchy 
(i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any 
stage in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various 
steps in the Risk Management Framework, including preparation, categorization, control 
selection, control implementation, control assessment, authorization, and control monitoring. 
Risk assessment is an ongoing activity carried out throughout the system development life cycle. 
Risk assessments can also address information related to the system, including system design, 
the intended use of the system, testing results, and supply chain-related information or artifacts. 
Risk assessments can play an important role in control selection processes, particularly during 
the application of tailoring guidance and in the earliest phases of capability determination.

RA-5,"VULNERABILITY MONITORING AND SCANNING  
Control: : 
a. Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined 
process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and 
reported; 
b. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among 
tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for: 
1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations; 
2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and 
3. Measuring vulnerability impact;  
c. Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability monitoring; 
d. Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in 
accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; 
e. Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control 
assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate 
similar vulnerabilities in other systems; and 
f. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the 
vulnerabilities to be scanned. 
Discussion:  Security categorization of information and systems guides the frequency and 
comprehensiveness of vulnerability monitoring (including scans). Organizations determine the 
required vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of 
vulnerabilities—such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors), 
networked printers, scanners, and copiers—are not overlooked. The capability to readily update 
vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced and as new 
scanning methods are developed helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by 
employed vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps 
to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as 
possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional 
approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three 
approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a 
variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary 
analyzers.  
Vulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, 
protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow 
control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability"
RA-6,"TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE COUNTERMEASURES SURVEY

defined locations] [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; when 
the following events or indicators occur: [Assignment: organization-defined events or 
indicators]]. 
Discussion:  A technical surveillance countermeasures survey is a service provided by qualified 
personnel to detect the presence of technical surveillance devices and hazards and to identify 
technical security weaknesses that could be used in the conduct of a technical penetration of the 
surveyed facility. Technical surveillance countermeasures surveys also provide evaluations of the 
technical security posture of organizations and facilities and include visual, electronic, and 
physical examinations of surveyed facilities, internally and externally. The surveys also provide 
useful input for risk assessments and information regarding organizational exposure to potential 
adversaries.

RA-7,"RISK RESPONSE 
 Control: :  Respond to findings from security and privacy assessments, monitoring, and audits in 
accordance with organizational risk tolerance. 
Discussion:  Organizations have many options for responding to risk including mitigating risk by 
implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls, accepting risk with appropriate 
justification or rationale, sharing or transferring risk, or avoiding risk. The risk tolerance of the 
organization influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response addresses the need to 
determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of action and milestones 
entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it may be possible to 
mitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action and milestones entry is not needed. 
However, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk, and the mitigation cannot be completed 
immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.

RA-8,"PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS 
Control: :  Conduct privacy impact assessments for systems, programs, or other activities before: 
a. Developing or procuring information technology that processes personally identifiable 
information; and 
b. Initiating a new collection of personally identifiable information that: 
1. Will be processed using information technology; and 
2. Includes personally identifiable information permitting the physical or virtual (online) 
contacting of a specific individual, if identical questions have been posed to, or identical 
reporting requirements imposed on, ten or more individuals, other than agencies, 
instrumentalities, or employees of the federal government. 
Discussion:  A privacy impact assessment is an analysis of how personally identifiable information 
is handled to ensure that handling conforms to applicable privacy requirements, determine the 
privacy risks associated with an information system or activity, and evaluate ways to mitigate 
privacy risks. A privacy impact assessment is both an analysis and a formal document that details 
the process and the outcome of the analysis. 
Organizations conduct and develop a privacy impact assessment with sufficient clarity and 
specificity to demonstrate that the organization fully considered privacy and incorporated 
appropriate privacy protections from the earliest stages of the organization’s activity and 
throughout the information life cycle. In order to conduct a meaningful privacy impact 
assessment, the organization’s senior agency official for privacy works closely with program 
managers, system owners, information technology experts, security officials, counsel, and other 
relevant organization personnel. Moreover, a privacy impact assessment is not a time-restricted 
activity that is limited to a particular milestone or stage of the information system or personally 
identifiable information life cycles. Rather, the privacy analysis continues throughout the system 
and personally identifiable information life cycles. Accordingly, a privacy impact assessment is a 
living document that organizations update whenever changes to the information technology, 
changes to the organization’s practices, or other factors alter the privacy risks associated with 
the use of such information technology. 
To conduct the privacy impact assessment, organizations can use security and privacy risk 
assessments. Organizations may also use other related processes that may have different names,"
RA-9,"CRITICALITY ANALYSIS 
Control: :  Identify critical system components and functions by performing a criticality analysis for 
[Assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services] at 
[Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle]. 
Discussion:  Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require significant 
protections. For example, criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and 
informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components 
and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives, policies, 
standards, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and 
component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to 
identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the 
identification of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the 
specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and 
firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared 
by many components within and  external to the system.  
The operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality, 
including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of-
systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical 
system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities that 
such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact 
of a component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported by the 
system that contains the components and functions. 
Criticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or 
upgraded. If such analysis is performed early in the system development life cycle, organizations 
may be able to modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and 
functions, such as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. Criticality 
analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development contractors. In 
addition to criticality analysis for systems, system components, and system services, criticality 
analysis of information is an important consideration. Such analysis is conducted as part of 
security categorization in RA-2.

Discussion:  A system development life cycle process provides the foundation for the successful 
development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems. The integration of 
security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle is a foundational 
principle of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls 
within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security 
and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical mission and business 
functions. The security engineering principles in"
SA-8,"help individuals properly design: , code, and 
test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior 
agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy 
architects, and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to 
ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational 
systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key 
security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to 
conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.  
The effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise architecture also 
helps to ensure that important security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout the 
system life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational mission and 
business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security and

SA-4,"ACQUISITION PROCESS 
 Control: :  Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, 
using [Selection (one or more): standardized contract language; [Assignment: organization-
defined contract language]] in the acquisition contract for the system, system component, or 
system service: 
a. Security and privacy functional requirements; 
b. Strength of mechanism requirements; 
c. Security and privacy assurance requirements; 
d. Controls needed to satisfy the security and privacy requirements. 
e. Security and privacy documentation requirements; 
f. Requirements for protecting security and privacy documentation; 
g. Description of the system development environment and environment in which the system 
is intended to operate; 
h. Allocation of responsibility or identification of parties responsible for information security, 
privacy, and supply chain risk management; and 
i. Acceptance criteria. 
Discussion:  Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-
level security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived requirements include 
security and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated 
with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, 
resistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements 
include development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from 
development and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required 
functionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. [SP 800-160-1] 
describes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle. 
Controls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate 
for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting 
the security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in 
order to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities. 
Controls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection 
and implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in 
the form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived 
requirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of 
implementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle. 
Security and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development 
life cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and 
operation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security 
categorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend 
on the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements 
can include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and 
services. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in 
the same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.

SA-5,"SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION 
 Control: : 
a. Obtain or develop administrator documentation for the system, system component, or 
system service that describes: 
1. Secure configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component, or service;  
2. Effective use and maintenance of security and privacy functions and mechanisms; and 
3. Known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative or privileged 
functions; 
b. Obtain or develop user documentation for the system, system component, or system service 
that describes: 
1. User-accessible security and privacy functions and mechanisms and how to effectively 
use those functions and mechanisms; 
2. Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, 
or service in a more secure manner and protect individual privacy; and 
3. User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service 
and privacy of individuals; 
c. Document attempts to obtain system, system component, or system service documentation 
when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent and take [Assignment: 
organization-defined actions] in response; and 
d. Distribute documentation to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]. 
Discussion:  System documentation helps personnel understand the implementation and 
operation of controls. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the 
quality and completeness of the content provided. System documentation may be used to 
support the management of supply chain risk, incident response, and other functions. Personnel 
or roles that require documentation include system owners, system security officers, and system 
administrators. Attempts to obtain documentation include contacting manufacturers or suppliers 
and conducting web-based searches. The inability to obtain documentation may occur due to the 
age of the system or component or the lack of support from developers and contractors. When 
documentation cannot be obtained, organizations may need to recreate the documentation if it 
is essential to the implementation or operation of the controls. The protection provided for the 
documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system. 
Documentation that addresses system vulnerabilities may require an increased level of 
protection. Secure operation of the system includes initially starting the system and resuming 
secure system operation after a lapse in system operation.

SA-8,"SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES 
 Control: :  Apply the following systems security and privacy engineering principles in the 
specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system and system 
components: [Assignment: organization-defined systems security and privacy engineering 
principles]. 
Discussion:  Systems security and privacy engineering principles are closely related to and 
implemented throughout the system development life cycle (see SA-3). Organizations can apply 
systems security and privacy engineering principles to new systems under development or to 
systems undergoing upgrades. For existing systems, organizations apply systems security and 
privacy engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given 
the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems. 
The application of systems security and privacy engineering principles helps organizations 
develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduces the susceptibility to disruptions, 
hazards, threats, and the creation of privacy problems for individuals. Examples of system 
security engineering principles include: developing layered protections; establishing security and 
privacy policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development; 
incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development life cycle; 
delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how 
to build secure software; tailoring controls to meet organizational needs; and performing threat 
modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and 
compensating controls needed to mitigate risk. 
Organizations that apply systems security and privacy engineering concepts and principles can 
facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system 
services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk management decisions. System 
security engineering principles can also be used to protect against certain supply chain risks, 
including incorporating tamper-resistant hardware into a design.

SA-9,"EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES 
 Control: : 
a. Require that providers of external system services comply with organizational security and 
privacy requirements and employ the following controls: [Assignment: organization-defined 
controls]; 
b. Define and document organizational oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard 
to external system services; and 
c. Employ the following processes, methods, and techniques to monitor control compliance by 
external service providers on an ongoing basis: [Assignment: organization-defined processes, 
methods, and techniques]. 
Discussion:  External system services are provided by an external provider, and the organization 
has no direct control over the implementation of the required controls or the assessment of 
control effectiveness. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a 
variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, 
lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain 
exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services 
remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires 
that organizations establish and retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the 
consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The 
extent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations and 
the external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the 
relationships can be monitored. External system services documentation includes government, 
service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. 
Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for implemented controls, 
describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified 
instances of noncompliance.

SA-11,"DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION 
Control: :  Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service, at all post-
design stages of the system development life cycle, to: 
a. Develop and implement a plan for ongoing security and privacy control assessments; 
b. Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression] testing/evaluation 
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] at [Assignment: organization-defined depth 
and coverage]; 
c. Produce evidence of the execution of the assessment plan and the results of the testing and 
evaluation; 
d. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and 
e. Correct flaws identified during testing and evaluation. 
Discussion:  Developmental testing and evaluation confirms that the required controls are 
implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security and privacy 
policies, and meeting established security and privacy requirements. Security properties of 
systems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection of system 
components or changes to those components. The interconnections or changes—including 
upgrading or replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware—may adversely affect 
previously implemented controls. Ongoing assessment during development allows for additional 
types of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential 
flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as manual code 
review, security architecture review, and penetration testing, as well as and static analysis, 
dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three analysis approaches. 
Developers can use the analysis approaches, along with security instrumentation and fuzzing, in a 
variety of tools and in source code reviews. The security and privacy assessment plans include 
the specific activities that developers plan to carry out, including the types of analyses, testing, 
evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components; the degree of rigor to be applied; 
the frequency of the ongoing testing and evaluation; and the types of artifacts produced during 
those processes. The depth of testing and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail 
associated with the assessment process. The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the 
scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts 
specify the acceptance criteria for security and privacy assessment plans, flaw remediation 
processes, and the evidence that the plans and processes have been diligently applied. Methods 
for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate 
with the security category or classification level of the system. Contracts may specify protection 
requirements for documentation.

Discussion:  Formal models describe specific behaviors or security and privacy policies using 
formal languages, thus enabling the correctness of those behaviors and policies to be 
formally proven. Not all components of systems can be modeled. Generally, formal 
specifications are scoped to the behaviors or policies of interest, such as nondiscretionary

b. Provide the following options for alternative sources for continued support for unsupported 
components [Selection (one or more): in-house support; [Assignment: organization-defined 
support from external providers]]. 
Discussion:  Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, 
replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components 
includes when vendors no longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can 
result in an opportunity for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components. 
Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical 
mission or business capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the 
systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option. 
Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system 
components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors 
when such components remain essential to organizational mission and business functions. If 
necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for 
critical software components or, alternatively, obtain the services of external providers who 
provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components through contractual 
relationships. Such contractual relationships can include open-source software value-added 
vendors. The increased risk of using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for 
example, by prohibiting the connection of such components to public or uncontrolled networks, 
or implementing other forms of isolation.

2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment:

Discussion:  System and communications protection policy and procedures address the controls 
in the SC family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management 
strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and 
procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security 
and privacy programs collaborate on the development of system and communications protection 
policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization 
level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies 
and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or 
be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures 
can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for 
systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can 
be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be 
documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events 
that may precipitate an update to system and communications protection policy and procedures 
include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable 
laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply 
restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

SC-2,"SEPARATION OF SYSTEM AND USER FUNCTIONALITY  
Control: :  Separate user functionality, including user interface services, from system management 
functionality. 
Discussion:  System management functionality includes functions that are necessary to 
administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers. These functions typically 
require privileged user access. The separation of user functions from system management 
functions is physical or logical. Organizations may separate system management functions from 
user functions by using different computers, instances of operating systems, central processing 
units, or network addresses; by employing virtualization techniques; or some combination of 
these or other methods. Separation of system management functions from user functions 
includes web administrative interfaces that employ separate authentication methods for users of 
any other system resources. Separation of system and user functions may include isolating 
administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls. The 
separation of system and user functionality can be achieved by applying the systems security 
engineering design principles in SA-8, including SA-8(1), SA-8(3), SA-8(4), SA-8(10), SA-8(12), SA-
8(13), SA-8(14), and SA-8(18).

(1) SEPARATION OF SYSTEM AND USER FUNCTIONALITY | INTERFACES FOR NON-PRIVILEGED USERS 
Prevent the presentation of system management functionality at interfaces to non-
privileged users. 
Discussion:  Preventing the presentation of system management functionality at interfaces 
to non-privileged users ensures that system administration options, including administrator 
privileges, are not available to the general user population. Restricting user access also 
prohibits the use of the grey-out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such 
information. One potential solution is to withhold system administration options until users 
establish sessions with administrator privileges.

SC-3,"SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION  
Control: :  Isolate security functions from nonsecurity functions. 
Discussion:  Security functions are isolated from nonsecurity functions by means of an isolation 
boundary implemented within a system via partitions and domains. The isolation boundary 
controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that 
perform system security functions. Systems implement code separation in many ways, such as 
through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel 
code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that protect 
the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Systems can restrict 
access to security functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege"
SC-4,"INFORMATION IN SHARED SYSTEM RESOURCES 
Control: :  Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system 
resources. 
Discussion:  Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system 
resources stops information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or the actions of 
processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles 
(or current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared 
system resources after those resources have been released back to the system. Information in 
shared system resources also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other 
contexts, control of information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and 
residual information protection. Information in shared system resources does not address 
information remanence, which refers to the residual representation of data that has been 
nominally deleted; covert channels (including storage and timing channels), where shared system 
resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within 
systems for which there are only single users or roles.

events: [Assignment: organization-defined types of denial-of-service events]; and 
b. Employ the following controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective: [Assignment: 
organization-defined controls by type of denial-of-service event]. 
Discussion:  Denial-of-service events may occur due to a variety of internal and external causes, 
such as an attack by an adversary or a lack of planning to support organizational needs with 
respect to capacity and bandwidth. Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network 
protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the 
origination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can 
filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being 
directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks. Employing increased network 
capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to 
denial-of-service events.

(1) DENIAL-OF-SERVICE PROTECTION | RESTRICT ABILITY TO ATTACK OTHER SYSTEMS 
Restrict the ability of individuals to launch the following denial-of-service attacks against 
other systems: [Assignment: organization-defined denial-of-service attacks]. 
Discussion:  Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial-of-service attacks requires 
the mechanisms commonly used for such attacks to be unavailable. Individuals of concern 
include hostile insiders or external adversaries who have breached or compromised the 
system and are using it to launch a denial-of-service attack. Organizations can restrict the 
ability of individuals to connect and transmit arbitrary information on the transport medium 
(i.e., wired networks, wireless networks, spoofed Internet protocol packets). Organizations 
can also limit the ability of individuals to use excessive system resources. Protection against 
individuals having the ability to launch denial-of-service attacks may be implemented on 
specific systems or boundary devices that prohibit egress to potential target systems. 
Related Controls:  None. 
(2) DENIAL-OF-SERVICE PROTECTION | CAPACITY, BANDWIDTH, AND REDUNDANCY 
Manage capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the effects of information

physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and 
c. Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces consisting of 
boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security and 
privacy architecture. 
Discussion:  Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based 
malicious code analysis, virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a 
security architecture. Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal 
networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces 
within organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers 
within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal 
addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses. [SP 
800-189] provides additional information on source address validation techniques to prevent 
ingress and egress of traffic with spoofed addresses. Commercial telecommunications services 
are provided by network components and consolidated management systems shared by 
customers. These services may also include third party-provided access lines and other service 
elements. Such services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security 
provisions. Boundary protection may be implemented as a common control for all or part of an 
organizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific 
boundary (i.e., an authorization boundary)."

Discussion:  Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information applies to 
internal and external networks as well as any system components that can transmit information, 
including servers, notebook computers, desktop computers, mobile devices, printers, copiers, 
scanners, facsimile machines, and radios. Unprotected communication paths are exposed to the 
possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of 
information can be accomplished by physical or logical means. Physical protection can be 
achieved by using protected distribution systems. A protected distribution system is a wireline or 
fiber-optics telecommunications system that includes terminals and adequate electromagnetic,"

Discussion:  Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual 
procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures. Organizations define 
key management requirements in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, 
regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines and specify appropriate options, parameters, and

Discussion:  Security and privacy attributes can be explicitly or implicitly associated with the 
information contained in organizational systems or system components. Attributes are 
abstractions that represent the basic properties or characteristics of an entity with respect to 
protecting information or the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes are 
typically associated with internal data structures, including records, buffers, and files within the 
system. Security and privacy attributes are used to implement access control and information 
flow control policies; reflect special dissemination, management, or distribution instructions, 
including permitted uses of personally identifiable information; or support other aspects of the 
information security and privacy policies. Privacy attributes may be used independently or in

organization. 
Discussion:  Public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates are certificates with visibility external to 
organizational systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems, such as 
application-specific time services. In cryptographic systems with a hierarchical structure, a trust 
anchor is an authoritative source (i.e., a certificate authority) for which trust is assumed and not 
derived. A root certificate for a PKI system is an example of a trust anchor. A trust store or 
certificate store maintains a list of trusted root certificates.

Discussion:  Providing authoritative source information enables external clients, including remote 
Internet clients, to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances for the 
host/service name to network address resolution information obtained through the service. 
Systems that provide name and address resolution services include domain name system (DNS) 
servers. Additional artifacts include DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) digital signatures and 
cryptographic keys. Authoritative data includes DNS resource records. The means for indicating 
the security status of child zones include the use of delegation signer resource records in the

system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure in systems and enhance redundancy, 
organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system servers—one configured as 
the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations 
typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not 
located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only 
process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from internal 
clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution information 
requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks, including the 
Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS servers in certain roles 
(e.g., by address ranges and explicit lists).

Discussion:  Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the targeting 
capabilities of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate 
and complete attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations with the 
ability to disguise systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the 
cost of having multiple platforms. The increased use of concealment and misdirection techniques 
and methods—including randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization—may sufficiently confuse 
and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing

Discussion:  Distributing processing and storage across multiple physical locations or logical 
domains provides a degree of redundancy or overlap for organizations. The redundancy and 
overlap increase the work factor of adversaries to adversely impact organizational operations, 
assets, and individuals. The use of distributed processing and storage does not assume a single

Discussion:  Distributed processing and/or storage may be used to reduce opportunities for 
adversaries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of organizational

SC-38,"OPERATIONS SECURITY 
Control: :  Employ the following operations security controls to protect key organizational 
information throughout the system development life cycle: [Assignment: organization-defined 
operations security controls]. 
Discussion:  Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential adversaries 
can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of organizations by identifying, 
controlling, and protecting generally unclassified information that specifically relates to the 
planning and execution of sensitive organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves five 
steps: identification of critical information, analysis of threats, analysis of vulnerabilities, 
assessment of risks, and the application of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC controls are"
SC-39,"PROCESS ISOLATION  
Control: :  Maintain a separate execution domain for each executing system process. 
Discussion:  Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by 
assigning each process a separate address space. Each system process has a distinct address 
space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through 
the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. 
Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, 
by implementing separate address spaces. Process isolation technologies, including sandboxing 
or virtualization, logically separate software and firmware from other software, firmware, and 
data. Process isolation helps limit the access of potentially untrusted software to other system 
resources. The capability to maintain separate execution domains is available in commercial 
operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.

separation will be enforced. Hardware separation mechanisms include hardware memory 
management.

Discussion:  Connection ports include Universal Serial Bus (USB), Thunderbolt, and Firewire (IEEE 
1394). Input/output (I/O) devices include compact disc and digital versatile disc drives. Disabling 
or removing such connection ports and I/O devices helps prevent the exfiltration of information 
from systems and the introduction of malicious code from those ports or devices. Physically

organization-defined exceptions where remote activation of sensors is allowed]]; and 
b. Provide an explicit indication of sensor use to [Assignment: organization-defined group of

Discussion:  Sensor capability and data applies to types of systems or system components 
characterized as mobile devices, such as cellular telephones, smart phones, and tablets. Mobile 
devices often include sensors that can collect and record data regarding the environment where 
the system is in use. Sensors that are embedded within mobile devices include microphones, 
cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While the sensors 
on mobiles devices provide an important function, if activated covertly, such devices can 
potentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable information about individuals and 
organizations. For example, remotely activating the GPS function on a mobile device could 
provide an adversary with the ability to track the movements of an individual. Organizations may 
prohibit individuals from bringing cellular telephones or digital cameras into certain designated 
facilities or controlled areas within facilities where classified information is stored or sensitive 
conversations are taking place.

Discussion:  Detonation chambers, also known as dynamic execution environments, allow 
organizations to open email attachments, execute untrusted or suspicious applications, and 
execute Universal Resource Locator requests in the safety of an isolated environment or a 
virtualized sandbox. Protected and isolated execution environments provide a means of 
determining whether the associated attachments or applications contain malicious code. While 
related to the concept of deception nets, the employment of detonation chambers is not 
intended to maintain a long-term environment in which adversaries can operate and their 
actions can be observed. Rather, detonation chambers are intended to quickly identify malicious 
code and either reduce the likelihood that the code is propagated to user environments of 
operation or prevent such propagation completely.

SC-45,"SYSTEM TIME SYNCHRONIZATION 
Control: :  Synchronize system clocks within and between systems and system components. 
Discussion:  Time synchronization of system clocks is essential for the correct execution of many 
system services, including identification and authentication processes that involve certificates 
and time-of-day restrictions as part of access control. Denial of service or failure to deny expired 
credentials may result without properly synchronized clocks within and between systems and 
system components. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a 
modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The 
granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks 
and reference clocks, such as clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of 
milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for system components. Time 
service can be critical to other security capabilities—such as access control and identification and 
authentication—depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support the capabilities.

path between interfaces to prevent the ability to bypass the policy enforcement mechanism. For 
physical policy enforcement mechanisms, the robustness of physical isolation afforded by the 
physical implementation of policy enforcement to preclude the presence of logical covert 
channels penetrating the security domain may be needed. Contact ncdsmo@nsa.gov for more

Discussion:  An incident, whether adversarial- or nonadversarial-based, can disrupt established 
communications paths used for system operations and organizational command and control. 
Alternate communications paths reduce the risk of all communications paths being affected by 
the same incident. To compound the problem, the inability of organizational officials to obtain 
timely information about disruptions or to provide timely direction to operational elements after 
a communications path incident, can impact the ability of the organization to respond to such 
incidents in a timely manner. Establishing alternate communications paths for command and 
control purposes, including designating alternative decision makers if primary decision makers 
are unavailable and establishing the extent and limitations of their actions, can greatly facilitate 
the organization’s ability to continue to operate and take appropriate actions during an incident.

Discussion:  Adversaries may take various paths and use different approaches as they move 
laterally through an organization (including its systems) to reach their target or as they attempt 
to exfiltrate information from the organization. The organization often only has a limited set of 
monitoring and detection capabilities, and they may be focused on the critical or likely infiltration 
or exfiltration paths. By using communications paths that the organization typically does not 
monitor, the adversary can increase its chances of achieving its desired goals. By relocating its 
sensors or monitoring capabilities to new locations, the organization can impede the adversary’s 
ability to achieve its goals. The relocation of the sensors or monitoring capabilities might be done 
based on threat information that the organization has acquired or randomly to confuse the 
adversary and make its lateral transition through the system or organization more challenging.

(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, 
coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and 
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and information integrity

Discussion:  System and information integrity policy and procedures address the controls in the SI 
family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is 
an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures 
contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy 
programs collaborate on the development of system and information integrity policy and 
procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are 
preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and 
procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be 
represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can 
be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for 
systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can 
be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be 
documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events 
that may precipitate an update to system and information integrity policy and procedures 
include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable 
laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply 
restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

potential side effects before installation; 
c. Install security-relevant software and firmware updates within [Assignment: organization-
defined time period] of the release of the updates; and 
d. Incorporate flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process. 
Discussion:  The need to remediate system flaws applies to all types of software and firmware. 
Organizations identify systems affected by software flaws, including potential vulnerabilities 
resulting from those flaws, and report this information to designated organizational personnel 
with information security and privacy responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches, 
service packs, and malicious code signatures. Organizations also address flaws discovered during 
assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. By 
incorporating flaw remediation into configuration management processes, required remediation 
actions can be tracked and verified. 
Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may 
vary based on a variety of risk factors, including the security category of the system, the criticality 
of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw), the organizational 
risk tolerance, the mission supported by the system, or the threat environment. Some types of 
flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the type 
of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and the 
types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may 
determine that the testing of software or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, such as 
when implementing simple malicious code signature updates. In testing decisions, organizations 
consider whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained from authorized 
sources with appropriate digital signatures.

1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of “387,” “abc,” or 
“%K%” are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to 
vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined 
protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between 
software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured

Discussion:  While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, predictable failure prevention is intended 
to address potential failures of system components that provide security capabilities. Failure 
rates reflect installation-specific consideration rather than the industry-average. Organizations 
define the criteria for the substitution of system components based on the MTTF value with 
consideration for the potential harm from component failures. The transfer of responsibilities 
between active and standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or 
security capabilities. The preservation of system state variables is also critical to help ensure a 
successful transfer process. Standby components remain available at all times except for 
maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.

SI-14,"NON: -PERSISTENCE 
Control:  Implement non-persistent [Assignment: organization-defined system components and 
services] that are initiated in a known state and terminated [Selection (one or more): upon end of 
session of use; periodically at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]]. 
Discussion:  Implementation of non-persistent components and services mitigates risk from 
advanced persistent threats (APTs) by reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., 
window of opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete attacks. By 
implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components, organizations can 
provide a trusted, known state computing resource for a specific time period that does not give 
adversaries sufficient time to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems or operating 
environments. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat with regard to capability, intent, 
and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period, a percentage of attacks will 
be successful. Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required using 
protected information and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence 
increases the work factor of adversaries attempting to compromise or breach organizational 
systems. 
Non-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, periodically reimaging 
components, or using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can 
be implemented by using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new 
instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent). The benefit of 
periodic refreshes of system components and services is that it does not require organizations to 
first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that 
may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components and services 
occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but not 
with such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes of critical components and 
services may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum 
windows of vulnerabilities.

a. Check the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of personally identifiable 
information across the information life cycle [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; 
and 
b. Correct or delete inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable information. 
Discussion:  Personally identifiable information quality operations include the steps that 
organizations take to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally identifiable information 
throughout the information life cycle. The information life cycle includes the creation, collection, 
use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal of personally 
identifiable information. Personally identifiable information quality operations include editing 
and validating addresses as they are collected or entered into systems using automated address 
verification look-up application programming interfaces. Checking personally identifiable 
information quality includes the tracking of updates or changes to data over time, which enables 
organizations to know how and what personally identifiable information was changed should 
erroneous information be identified. The measures taken to protect personally identifiable 
information quality are based on the nature and context of the personally identifiable 
information, how it is to be used, how it was obtained, and the potential de-identification 
methods employed. The measures taken to validate the accuracy of personally identifiable 
information used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals

Control: 
a. Remove the following elements of personally identifiable information from datasets: 
[Assignment: organization-defined elements of personally identifiable information]; and 
b. Evaluate [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] for effectiveness of de-identification. 
Discussion:  De-identification is the general term for the process of removing the association 
between a set of identifying data and the data subject. Many datasets contain information about 
individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social 
security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records. Datasets 
may also contain other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, 
educational, financial, and employment information. Personally identifiable information is 
removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is not (or no longer) 
necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data. For example, if the dataset is only 
used to produce aggregate statistics, the identifiers that are not needed for producing those 
statistics are removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy protection since information that is 
removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly used.
 Organizations may be subject to 
specific de-identification definitions or methods under applicable laws, regulations, or policies. 
Re-identification is a residual risk with de-identified data. Re-identification attacks can vary, 
including combining new datasets or other improvements in data analytics. Maintaining 
awareness of potential attacks and evaluating for the effectiveness of the de-identification over 
time support the management of this residual risk.

 Control: :  Embed data or capabilities in the following systems or system components to

Discussion:  Many cyber-attacks target organizational information, or information that the 
organization holds on behalf of other entities (e.g., personally identifiable information), and 
exfiltrate that data. In addition, insider attacks and erroneous user procedures can remove 
information from the system that is in violation of the organizational policies. Tainting 
approaches can range from passive to active. A passive tainting approach can be as simple as 
adding false email names and addresses to an internal database. If the organization receives 
email at one of the false email addresses, it knows that the database has been compromised. 
Moreover, the organization knows that the email was sent by an unauthorized entity, so any"

Discussion:  Retaining information for longer than it is needed makes it an increasingly valuable 
and enticing target for adversaries. Keeping information available for the minimum period of 
time needed to support organizational missions or business functions reduces the opportunity 
for adversaries to compromise, capture, and exfiltrate that information.

Discussion:  Actions taken by a system service or a function are often driven by the information it 
receives. Corruption, fabrication, modification, or deletion of that information could impact the 
ability of the service function to properly carry out its intended actions. By having multiple 
sources of input, the service or function can continue operation if one source is corrupted or no 
longer available. It is possible that the alternative sources of information may be less precise or 
less accurate than the primary source of information. But having such sub-optimal information

(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, 
standards, and guidelines; and 
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the supply chain risk management policy

2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment:

Discussion:  Supply chain risk management policy and procedures address the controls in the SR 
family as well as supply chain-related controls in other families that are implemented within 
systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing 
such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy 
assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the 
development of supply chain risk management policy and procedures. Security and privacy 
program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may 
obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be 
included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies 
that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and 
privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures 
describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or 
role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and 
privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to 
supply chain risk management policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, 
security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, 
regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an 
organizational policy or procedure.

SR-2,"SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Control: : 
a. Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research and 
development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and 
maintenance, and disposal of the following systems, system components or system services: 
[Assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services]; 
b. Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-
defined frequency] or as required, to address threat, organizational or environmental 
changes; and 
c. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and 
modification. 
Discussion:  The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well 
as the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an 
organization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized 
production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software 
and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply 
chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an 
organization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted 
undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships 
and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management 
(SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response 
actions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance 
against plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy 
implementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or 
incorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing, 
implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems 
across the SDLC to support mission and business functions. 
Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are 
tailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans 
provide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is 
fit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans 
help organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions 
based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk 
management plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization, 
acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently 
evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating 
the plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and 
associated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address 
requirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system 
components and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented 
as part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8
).
