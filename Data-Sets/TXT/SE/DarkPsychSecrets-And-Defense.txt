Chapter 1: What is Dark Psychology? There are many different ways to define dark psychology, but in this book, we will go with the simplest one. Dark Psychology is the art and science of manipulation and mind control. Psychology, in general, seeks to study and understand human behavior. It is focused on our thoughts, actions, and the way we interact with each other. Dark psychology, however, just focuses on the kinds of thoughts and actions that are predatory in nature. Dark psychology examines the tactics used by malicious people to motivate, persuade, manipulate, or coerce others into acting in ways that are beneficial to themselves, and potentially detrimental to the other person. Dark psychology can be seen as the study of the human condition, in relation to the psychological nature of the different kinds of people who prey on others. The fact is that every single human being has the potential to victimize other people or other living creatures. However, due to social norms, the human conscience, and other factors, most humans tend to restrain their dark urges and to keep themselves from acting on every impulse that they have. However, there is a small percentage of the population that is unable to keep their dark urges in check, and they harm others in seemingly unimaginable ways. The point of dark psychology, as a subject, is to try to understand those thoughts, feelings, and perceptions that cause people to behave in predatory ways towards each other. Experts in dark psychology work under the assumption that the vast majority of human predatory actions are purposeful. In other words, most of the people who prey on others (99.99%) do it for specific reasons, while the remaining people (0.01%) do it for no reason at all. The assumption is that when people do evil things, they have specific motivations, some of which may even be completely rational from their point of view. People do bad things with specific goals in mind and specific rationales for their actions, and only a tiny fraction of the population brutally victimizes others without a purpose that can be reasonably explained by either evolutionary science or some form of religious dogma. You have heard many times that everyone has a dark side. All cultures and belief systems acknowledge this dark side to some extent. Our society refers to it as “evil” while some cultures and religions have gone so far as to create mythical beings to whom they attribute that evil (the devil, Satan, demons, etc.). Experts in dark psychology posit that there as some among us who commit the worst kinds of evil, for purposes that are unknown. While most people may do evil things to gain power, money, retribution, or for sexual purposes, there are those who do evil things because that’s just who they are. They commit acts of horror for absolutely no reason. In other words, their ends don’t justify their means; they cause harm for its own sake. Dark psychology is rooted in 4 dark personality traits. These traits are; narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism. People with such traits tend to act in ways that are pointlessly harmful to others. Let’s look at examples of how dark psychological aspects are manifested in the real world: “I-Predators” are people or groups of people who use modern technology to prey on others, either directly or indirectly. As we have mentioned, everyone has a dark side, and the anonymity that the internet offers has a way of bringing out that dark side in many of us. The result is that there is an ever- increasing number of people who are looking to exploit, coerce, stalk, and victimize others online, and through the use of other technological tools. These predators seem to be driven by deviant fantasies, which they feel free to play out because the internet makes it possible for them to lurk in the shadows. In other words, they are not restricted by the usual social norms that keep people from revealing their dark side because no one online knows their real identities. These people tend to have all sort of prejudices and preconceptions, which they go to great lengths to impose on others. I-Predators come in different shapes and sizes; there are stalkers, harassers, criminals, perverts, terrorist, bullies, conmen, and even trolls. No matter what kind of predators they are, they all tend to have a self-awareness of the fact that they are harming others. They also tend to go out of their way to cover their tracks, which means they don’t want the people who know them in real life to discover that they have a dark side. Arson is also a different manifestation of dark psychology. Arsonists are people who tend to be obsessively preoccupied with setting fires. Some of them become serial arsonists; they set fires regularly and in a manner that is highly ritualistic. Necrophiliacs are people who are sexually interested in the dead, while serial killers are people who murder three or more people over a prolonged period of time. These are some of the most extreme manifestations of dark psychology, and although they are rare (as a function of the overall population), they are still worth discussing if you want to understand dark psychology. Experts in the field of criminal psychology believe that serial killers and other evildoers are motivated by the pursuit of psychological gratification, which they can only achieve by performing those brutal acts. To the people who perform the worst kinds of evil acts, those acts are like drugs to them; they are addictive in a way. For instance, when a serial killer gets some form of gratification from murdering someone, he may feel the urge to do it again in order to experience the same gratification. For the purposes of this book, we won’t be discussing the darkest aspects of dark psychology; instead, we will be looking at those aspects that you are more likely to experience in your day to day life. We will be looking at how you can deal with people who are narcissistic, sadistic, Machiavellian, and psychopathic. We will look at why and how they do what they do, and what you can do to keep yourself from falling victim to their machinations. Chapter 2: The 4 Dark Psychology Traits For a long time, psychologists have referred to the dark human traits as "the dark triad," which consists of three negative personality traits; narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. However, in recent years, many experts in the field have been insisting that garden-variety sadism should also be added to the list of major dark psychological traits. As a result, we are now moving away from the dark triad and toward the "4 dark psychology traits". In this chapter, we will take a look at each of the four traits and discuss them in detail. Before we look at those traits, it’s important to note that understanding them is very crucial if you want to have functional knowledge of how to avoid being manipulated. In fact, research into these traits has many applications in different fields, including; clinical psychology, law enforcement, and even business management. Studies show that people who score high when tested for the four traits are more likely to commit crimes, to cause problems within organizations, to cause distress to the people in their lives, and to society in general. In business situations, it may be important to keep people with such traits away from positions of power. We encounter instances of narcissism, Machiavellianism, sadism, and non- clinical psychopathy on a regular basis, and if we are keen, we might be able to notice them. Statistically, we all have these traits in us to some extent. In fact, when psychologists test people for these traits, they use testing methods that assume that these traits exist in a spectrum. To take sadism as an example, such tests imply that instead of having people who are sadistic and those who are not sadistic, we have people who have high levels of sadism and those who have low levels of sadism. Another important thing to note is that some of the characteristics that are displayed by people with each of the four traits can overlap, and this can be confusing, even for people who have professional training in psychology. For example, narcissists may behave in ways that are similar to Machiavellians or sadists. Because of this, it may be hard to tell what kind of dark trait a person has just by observing them for a short period of time. If someone does something that’s detrimental to others, you could be able to tell which dark trait the person has by examining the motivation, or the extent of the evil action. Don’t jump to conclusions; take some time to examine the person's behavior closely before you make any judgment. If the person’s actions are detrimental to you, it may be hard to stay objective when you are analyzing his dark personality trait, but it’s important to remember that you can only appropriately deal with people if you have a good understanding of their traits and motivations. You can try to remove yourself from the situation and analyze the person as an objective third-party observer. Narcissism Narcissism is the dark trait that is displayed by individuals who are narcissists. Narcissists display high levels of grandiosity, superiority, dominance, and entitlement. Narcissists tend to be charming people who have a positive outlook, which is why they are good at fooling other people. According to psychologists, narcissists are usually on the lookout for people to feed into their “narcissistic supply” because they want to use those people to build their own egos. They also lack empathy for others. One main characteristic that you see in narcissists is that they are quite good at building and cultivating relationships, and they can initially blind people to the fact that they are acting out of self-interest. We all tend to have narcissistic traits to varying extents, but there are few among us who have Narcissistic Personality Disorder. The terms Narcissist and Narcissism come from Narcissus, a character in Greek mythology. Narcissus was a hunter and a very attractive young man. He was so attractive that everyone seemed to fall in love with him. However, he only treated people with contempt and disdain, and he never returned the love that others showed him. Because of this, he was cursed by Nemesis (the goddess of revenge) to fall in love with his reflection in a pool of water. Just like Narcissus, modern-day narcissists are in love with themselves. However, psychologists have come to discover that narcissist don’t love the real versions of themselves; they are in love with perfect versions of themselves, which only exist in their imaginations. It’s easy to assume that narcissists have high self-esteem, but that is not actually the case; they have a perverse kind of self-esteem that is not predicated on accepting or loving who they are but loving a fictitious grandiose version of themselves. When a narcissist acts out of self-interest to someone’s detriment, it’s usually in pursuit of that grand vision of himself, even though he knows for a fact that it’s not real. Narcissists have an exaggerated sense of self-importance. They think they deserve to be treated better than everyone else around them. They have an exaggerated sense of entitlement, and they truly believe that when they receive favorable treatment in certain situations, it is for the common good. A narcissist thinks that when he is taking advantage of you, he is actually doing you a favor. This way, he can rationalize a lot of selfish and evil acts. In a relationship, a narcissist will think of himself as more important and more deserving than the other person. In the workplace, a narcissist will think that he has more natural talent than his colleagues, and he, therefore, deserves to be put in charge of projects or to be promoted ahead of everyone else. The interesting thing about narcissism is that in some cases, it can make someone successful. Narcissism can be a self-fulfilling prophesy. When a narcissistic person believes that he is smarter than everyone else, he may work hard to prove it, and in the end, he may be more accomplished in his career. When a narcissist believes that he should be in a leadership position, he may exude confidence and acquire leadership traits, and the people around him will become truly convinced that he deserves to be their leader. Because of this fact, some have argued that narcissism could be a positive trait in a person who is ethical. The problem, however, is that most narcissists seem to believe that their needs come before everyone else's, so sooner or later, they are likely to do something unethical, and to betray the trust of those who hold them in high esteem. Narcissists who seem confident at the beginning will often turn out to be arrogant. A narcissist who seems ethical at the beginning will throw ethics out of the window as soon as he feels that his dominance is being threatened. Narcissists believe that they are special, and to reinforce this belief, they surround themselves with people who tend to be agreeable. They want to be around people who will validate their inflated sense of self-worth. Now, even the most agreeable people have the ability to spot flaws in others, and after spending some time with narcissists, they will stop affirming the negative actions of the narcissist. To prevent this, narcissists try to control the thoughts and actions of the people around them. Narcissists are very controlling. They control people in both covert and overt ways. They try to manipulate others so that they keep feeding their “narcissistic supply,” and when people try to break from their control, they can react with anger or rage. In relationships, narcissists are more likely to practice domestic abuse because they are trying to keep the other person under their thumb. At work, narcissists are more likely to act vindictively because they want to punish others for challenging their dominance. Later in the book, we will discuss ways to deal with narcissistic people. Machiavellianism Machiavellianism is a dark trait that involves deceitfulness and manipulation. Machiavellians tend to be very cynical people (not that they are skeptical or they have doubtful curiosity; they just don’t care for the moral restrictions that the rest of society adheres to). They tend to be amoral and self-interested. They don't have a sense of right and wrong; they'll take any course of action, as long as it serves their interests. Machiavellians are cold, unprincipled, and they are naturally adept at interpersonal manipulation. They believe that life is a zero-sum game and that the key to success is manipulating others. They approach all kinds of relationships with a cold, calculating attitude, and to them, when they desire a certain outcome in a given situation, the end invariably justifies the means. Machiavellianism is named after Niccolo Machiavelli, the Italian political philosopher who is best known for writing The Prince. The book offers advice on how one can control the masses and manipulate people in order to gain power over them. The book teaches people to be cunning, manipulative, and deceitful, as long as they get what they want. It argues that in pursuit of one's interests, it’s morally justifiable to harm others. In this sense, Machiavellianism is similar to narcissism because, in both traits, there is an underlying belief that one’s own interests serve the common good, even if people are hurt in the process. People with these traits are likely to cheat, lie, and harm others in order to achieve their goals. They are emotionally detached from the people around them, so if you are in a relationship with them, you may notice that all your experiences are shallow. They won’t hesitate to harm others if it’s expedient for them. Where narcissist, sadists, and psychopaths may harm others for their own enjoyment, because they lack empathy, or to fulfill certain emotional needs, Machiavellians will do it for a rational and arguably pragmatic purpose. They have little consideration for the emotional collateral damage that they leave behind; in fact, they only care about others’ emotions if they know it will come back to haunt them. Machiavellians seem to have "cold empathy" as opposed to "hot empathy." Cold empathy is an understanding of how people may think or act in certain situations, or how certain events may unfold. On the other hand, hot empathy refers to be being aware of and caring about people's emotions in a given situation. Normal people have hot empathy, which means that they understand how others feel, and they take care not to negatively impact the sensibilities of those around them. Machiavellians tend to understand the moves that others are likely to make in specific situations, but they don’t resonate with other people’s emotions. As a result, they tend to come across as unfriendly, emotionally distant, and harsh. Some psychologists and anthropologists have argued that Machiavellianism could be an evolutionary advantage and that it’s, therefore, a desirable trait. Machiavellians understand people’s emotional reactions, which helps them deal with real and perceived threats, but they can technically bypass empathy when reacting to threats, which means that their actions are more effective. If the rule of the jungle (survival of the fittest) applies, then Machiavellians are more likely to thrive. The problem with this argument is that we are not in the jungle anymore, and society only functions if we all care about the welfare of others. Machiavellians are master manipulators, and they are highly likely to be involved in white collar crimes. People with this trait are more likely to be involved in embezzlement schemes, pyramid schemes, stock swindling schemes, overpricing schemes, and political crimes. They work their way to the top by manipulating people, and when they get to positions of power (whether in business or in politics), they use the same techniques to manipulate the masses. Psychopathy Of all the dark traits, psychopathy is the most malevolent. Psychopaths have very low levels of empathy, so they don't care for others. On the other hand, they have extremely high levels of impulsiveness, and they are thrill-seeking individuals. They are very callous, very manipulative, and they have a heightened sense of grandiosity. They seek thrills without caring about the harm that they inflict on others in the process. Psychopaths are more difficult to spot than you might think. They tend to keep normal outward appearances; even though they lack empathy and a conscience, they learn to act normally by observing others' emotional reactions. They can even come across as charming when they are trying to manipulate you. They are volatile, and they have criminal tendencies, although this isn’t always the case. There is a lot of interest and fascination with psychopaths, which is why you see so many depictions of them in pop culture. However, with fascination comes misconceptions. We tend to think of psychopaths as serial killers, bomber, super villains, and people who are certifiably insane, and the danger here is that we forget that most psychopaths are just normal (at least by all appearances), and they can harm us in other ways. People who like starting fights, who disregard your emotions and those who consistently lie to you may turn out to be psychopaths. Adult psychopathy cannot be treated. However, when psychopathic tendencies are observed in children and young people, they can be put through certain programs that teach them to be less callous and more considerate of others. A key thing you need to understand is the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath. In colloquial conversations, these two terms are often used interchangeably, but in psychology, they have different meanings. A sociopath is a person who has antisocial tendencies. Now, these antisocial tendencies are usually a result of social and environmental factors; for example, a person who has a bad childhood may turn out to be a sociopath because he doesn’t trust society in general, or he has developed certain psychological issues as a result of the unfavorable upbringing. On the other hand, psychopathic traits are innate. People don't become psychopaths; they are born psychopaths. However, social and environmental factors may contribute to a person's particular brand of psychopathy. For example, people who are born with psychopathic traits and are brought up in an environment that is chaotic and violent, are more likely to have more pronounced manifestations of their psychopathy. Experts agree that there are three main factors that contribute towards psychopathy; genetics, brain anatomy, and environmental factors. Like the other dark traits, psychopathy exists on a spectrum. Clinicians use a scale assessment system to measure the level of psychopathy; everyone falls somewhere on that scale, but people with a score of 30 and above as considered to have psychopathy that rises to the level of clinical significance. The Hare Psychopathy Checklist is used by mental health professionals to check for psychopathy, mostly in clinical patients and in criminals, but if you suspect that someone you are dealing with is a psychopath, you can find it online and use it for free as a guide if you want to know for sure that you are indeed dealing with a psychopath. Sadism Like the other three dark traits, sadism is characterized by callousness. Sadists tend to have normal levels of impulsiveness and manipulation, which explains why this trait wasn’t originally included in what is now known as the "dark triad." The defining characteristic of sadists is that they enjoy cruelty. Everyday sadists tend to be normal and functional by all indications, but they enjoy harming others. Sadists are referred to as “everyday sadists” because it’s important to make a distinction between them and the narcissists, Machiavellians, and psychopaths who may manifest sadism as part of their other dark traits. Sadists are intrinsically motivated to cause others harm, even if they are completely innocent. Sometimes, sadists can prioritize the infliction of emotional pain on others even if it comes at a personal cost to them. They find cruelty to be pleasurable and exciting, and some even find it sexually stimulating. Some psychologists have noted that sadists are often drawn towards career paths where they are allowed to harm other people under the guise of legitimate work. That means that many of them flock towards law enforcement, the military, etc. Psychologists have observed that when the levels of sadism in police forces are compared to the levels of sadism in the general population, the levels within police departments are always invariably higher. This could explain why police forces often have problems with some of their members taking the law into their own hands. Sadists tend to inflict pain on people around them for no reason, and they are likely to escalate, especially when they discover that the person in question is less likely to push back. That explains why bullies keep picking on people who don't stand up to them. Sadists are the kind of people who would tell your secrets to other people even after promising to keep them private because they enjoy it when you experience discomfort. They are also more likely to portray others in false or unflattering terms, with the intention of damaging the other person’s reputation; while Machiavellians may do this to advance their personal agenda, sadists would do this because it’s fun for them. Sadists may also work actively to get you fired from your job or to jeopardize your success, not because they want to get ahead of you, but just because they want you to be unhappy. They may also try to ruin your personal relationships; they’ll cause turmoil in your relationship, then sit back and enjoy the drama and misery. They are more likely to steal other people's property, not because they need it, but because they don't want what the other person to have it. They are more likely to bully you either in real life or online. You can always spot a sadist by the comments and remarks he makes online. Most internet trolls tend to be everyday sadists. They will make negative comments about pretty much anything, not because they strongly believe in the opinion that they have, but because they want to annoy you or get a rise out of you. They’ll always find something negative to say about even the most unifying things online. With trolls, the more you engage with them, the more energized they become, and the more they’ll bother you online. Chapter 3: Psychological Manipulation Techniques Psychological manipulation is defined as a form of social influence which seeks to alter the behavior and the perceptions of others, by the use of tactics that are indirect, deceptive, and underhanded. In other words, it’s about using certain tricks to get people to act in a certain way or to think certain things, usually to the advantage of whoever is perpetrating the manipulation. This way, the interests of the manipulator are advanced, usually at the expense of the other person in that equation. Psychological manipulation employs methods that are both devious and exploitative, and they are often used by people who have one or more of the dark personality traits that we discussed in the previous chapter. Now, from the very start, we need to make sure you understand that not all psychological manipulation and social influence is negative. It’s possible to manipulate someone for their own good. For instance, parents may manipulate their children into eating vegetables. In as much as that is manipulation, it ends up benefiting the child because his or her health is improved. Similarly, friends, family members, and healthcare professionals may try to influence you using certain manipulation technique with the aim of getting you to make the right choices in certain situations. Social influence is a normal and important part of social discourse. In healthy social influence, there is no aspect of coercion. In other words, when a well- meaning person tries to influence you, and you resist that influence, they are not going to strong-arm you into doing what they want. However, in unhealthy psychological manipulation, the manipulator often resorts to coercive techniques if they sense that you are resistant to the softer techniques that they have been trying to use on you. When malicious people deploy psychological manipulation techniques against you, they usually try to conceal the aggressive nature of their intentions, so you have to understand that most of their techniques are designed to be subtle. Most of them will also take some time to get to know you and understand your psychological vulnerabilities before they can decide which manipulation techniques will work on you. This means that just because you have known someone for a while, and you haven’t seen them try to harm you in any way, it doesn’t guarantee the fact that their intentions are pure, which means that you shouldn’t start disregarding your instincts about them. The best manipulators are those who reveal their intentions long after you have decided to trust them. Remember that manipulators generally have a tendency toward ruthlessness, so even if they are treating you well at the beginning of your association with them, pay close attention to the way they act towards others. If you see them using manipulation techniques against other people, you should know that it’s just a matter of time before they get around to using the same techniques against you. In this chapter, we discuss the most common psychological manipulation techniques that are used by people who mean to harm you or to take advantage or you. It’s important to understand these techniques and how they work so that you can be able to spot them when they are being used against you or someone close to you, and so that you can know how to defend against them. Gaslighting Gaslighting is one of the most lethal psychological manipulation techniques out there. It’s where a manipulator tries to get their target to start questioning their own reality. It involves getting someone to doubt their own memories and perceptions, and instead, to start believing what the manipulator wants them to believe. The manipulator will sow seeds of doubt in the person so that they start thinking that either they remember things wrong, or they are losing their sanity. Gaslighting involves the persistent denial of things that obvious facts. It also involves a lot of misdirection, contradictions, and blatant lying. When a person is subjected to gaslighting for a long time, they start to become unstable, and they start feeling as though their own beliefs are illegitimate. One common example of gaslighting is where an abuser convinces the victim that the abusive incident she recalls did not even occur. This phenomenon is more common than you might imagine, and it happens in all sorts of relationships. An abusive spouse might deny ever abusing you when confronted later, by either blatantly denying that they abuse occurred, or claiming that it didn’t happen as you remember and that your version of the events is greatly exaggerated. A manipulative boss or colleague might prey on a subordinate and later deny that it happened that way. Someone who groped you might later claim that they "accidentally brushed against you," and they may insist on it so much, to the point that you start thinking that maybe you were mistaken. You may wonder; “How does it even work? I mean, I have a firm grasp of my own reality, and I doubt someone could be able to convince me that my perceptions are wrong!” It’s easy to assume that gaslighting won’t work on you because you are smart or because you are strong-willed, but the truth is that when a manipulator is good at what he is doing, you might not even see it coming. The way it works is that it often starts with small lies on the manipulator's part and small concessions on your part. Say, for example, your boyfriend shows up a few minutes late to an appointment when you had agreed to meet at a specific time, and he insists that he is on time and that it’s you who came in a bit earlier and is mistaken about the timing that you agreed upon. At that moment, you might think, "Well, a 10-minute difference isn't such a big deal, and maybe we just got our lines crossed". You could dismiss this small discrepancy because it seems inconsequently, but that will just be the beginning. The next time, the lie will get a little bigger, and you will feel obligated to excuse it as well, because you already let something else slide, so it would seem inconsistent if you made a big fuss at this point. After that initial seed is sown, the lies will start to escalate, and you will continue making concessions and agreeing with things that you know are lies, until one day, you realize that you are so far gone. You might not even notice when the small lies graduate into bigger lies. In every step of the way, you will be letting go of your reality and accepting the other person's version of things, and you will find yourself trusting their judgment over your own. In a nutshell, gaslighting involves desensitizing you to your own reality, until the truth becomes what the other person says it is. Gaslighting is more likely to work in situations where there is a power dynamic between two people, or between a person and a group of people. In a relationship where the victim is financially or emotionally dependent on the manipulator, the victim may accept to let go of her reality because its more comfortable to do so than to stand up to the manipulator, only to end up losing the relationship. In the workplace, a subordinate may go along with the boss’s lies because he is afraid of losing his job. In a situation where a leader gaslight his followers, it often works because deep within, the followers want to believe whatever lies the leader is telling them. There are several techniques that gas lighters use to get a stranglehold on their victims. One such technique is withholding. This is where the manipulator refuses to listen to what the victim says or pretends not to understand what they are saying. You might bring up something important, but the response you get is, "I don't even remember this thing you keep talking about." Another gaslighting technique is called countering. This is where the manipulator questions the victim’s memory of the events in questions. They say things like “Were you even sober? Because that is not how that happened." The manipulator would then go on to offer an entirely different version of the story, where he casts himself as the hero or even the "real victim." Gas lighters also use blocking and diverting as a manipulation technique. This is where they change the story or question the way the victim is thinking in order to avoid addressing whatever issue the victim is raising. Trivializing is also a common gaslighting technique. This is where the manipulator makes the victim feel that her feelings or needs aren't that important, or that she is just being unnecessarily dramatic. Manipulators in such cases may say things like "don't blow things out of proportion." You may be able to tell if someone is gaslighting you if you find that you are frequently second-guessing yourself, or that your convictions fade away when you interact with a certain person. If a person makes you ruminate about certain character flaws, they are most likely gaslighting you. Someone who tells you that you are too emotional might really be trying to get you to stop trusting your emotions. If you feel confused about the nature of your relationship, or you feel like the person is driving you crazy, or that you are losing control when you are with them, they might be gaslighting you. If you walk into a room with the intention of having a discussion about something specific, but a few moments later, you find yourself arguing with your partner about a whole other topic, it means that the person is deliberately frustrating your genuine efforts to communicate, and it could be a sign of gaslighting. If you feel fuzzy about your own beliefs, thoughts, and feelings whenever you are with someone that is a clear red flag. When you are being gaslighted, you might also find that you are constantly apologizing for “being mistaken” or that you are frequently making excuses to yourself and to others for your partner’s behavior. Projection Projection is a psychological manipulation technique where someone transfers their emotions and mistakes onto you. Projection is a defense mechanism that almost everyone uses to some extent. We all have a natural tendency to project our negative emotions and undesirable feelings onto the people around us, and this often happens when we feel like we have been put on the spot. However, in as much as we all do it, narcissists and people with other dark personality traits tend to do it excessively and to absurd extents. Toxic people find it very difficult to admit even to themselves that the nasty things around them could be a result of their own doing, and they always find people to blame for every little thing that happens. Such people often go out of their way to avoid taking responsibility for their own actions. As a result, they may assign their negative behavior and traits to you. For example, if you have a boss who is always late to work, you might be surprised to find him accusing you of tardiness even if you are consistently punctual. A kleptomaniac is more likely to accuse you of stealing his/her personal items. In relationships, a manipulator who cheats on your is more likely to accuse you of cheating in him/her or to act in a way that suggests that he/she suspects you of cheating. When a person is cheating on you, he may choose to spy on you by checking your messages, phone calls, and emails, and he is more likely to barrage you with questions every time you are a few minutes late. Now, a good partner may get a little suspicious or insecure if you suddenly become more secretive or absent, but if your partner starts treating you with suspicion even if you acting completely normal, chances are they are the ones who are cheating, and they are just projecting it onto you. Manipulators tend to project partly because they want to destruct you and to keep you on the defensive, and this gives them more control over your life. When they accuse you of certain things, and you feel like you owe them an explanation, it allows them to dominate you; in other words, it becomes as though they are the “boss or you” and you now have to answer to them. As you frantically try to defend yourself from the accusations that they have made against you, they get to do whatever they want, and you never get the time to call them out on their mistakes. They are also counting on the fact that it would feel weird and childish if you accused them of the exact thing, they have already accused you of, so it takes away the possibility that you might confront them based on suspicions that you might have. As we have mentioned, projection is something that everyone does, and that can complicate things for you if a manipulative person project onto you. When someone projects negative emotions onto you, you might have a natural inclination to project your sense of empathy and compassion back onto them. This explains why projection works so well as a manipulation technique. Even when someone is accusing you of doing something bad, you will still feel compassion for them, and you will go out of your way to reassure them that they are mistaken; but when you do this, they win, albeit with your help. When you feel like someone is projecting onto you, the best thing you can do is leave your own emotions out of the equation and try to respond as rationally as possible. Isolation We all have social support systems that help us cope with difficult situations and keep us from making decisions that are bad for us. We have friends and family members who take notice when our behavior changes, or when we start hanging out with "bad people," and they always watch our backs. Manipulators understand this, and one of the first things that they'll do when trying to gain control over your life is to isolate you. Isolation facilitates abuse because it takes away any recourse that you might have when someone starts getting abusive. It closes a victim's avenues of escape, and it increases their sense of helplessness. It ensures that when things go south, there's no one there to rescue you. It increases the power that the abuser or manipulator has over the victim because it makes the victim more dependent on the abuser. Isolating the victim from the outside world is widely used by all sort of manipulators. When a cult leader tries to indoctrinate young recruits, he will make sure that they are locked away so that he can have complete control over the information that they receive. The same happens in abusive relationships, workplace bullying, and many other areas. When an abuser sets out to isolate you, he will start by driving a wedge between you and the people that you depend on. He will learn everything about the dynamics between you and your family and friends, and he will use the weaknesses in your bonds to sow distrust and conflict. For example, if a guy knows that you are close with your sister, but you have some unresolved childhood conflicts with her, he may try to reignite those conflicts so that you start drifting apart. In the workplace, a manipulator may create animosity between you and your colleagues so that they get mad at you and stop siding with you or watching your back. If you join a cult or any sort of group and the leader is a manipulator, he may insist that you cut ties with your family and friends, and only depend on other people within that group. Rivals in business, at work, or even in your personal life can isolate you by smearing your name and discrediting you with other members of the community. “Divide and conquer” is also a form of isolation that is used especially by people with the Machiavellianism trait. In this instance, the manipulator is using isolation as a double-edged sword to gain control over both parties that are being pulled apart from each other. Once an abuser has managed to isolate you, he will take his abuse to the next level because he knows you have no one to turn to. In fact, other manipulation techniques such as gaslighting work even more effectively when a person is isolated. They say that love is blind, and sometimes, at the beginning or relationships, we are blind to the dark traits of the people we are dating. Some manipulators may try to isolate you from the very first time you meet them. If you start dating someone and you notice that he never wants to hang out at your place, or he never wants you to bring your friends along on casual dates, chances are he is trying to isolate you so that you cannot get your friends to give you an objective assessment of his character. In the workplace, isolation can take many different forms. A person may isolate you by denying you access to certain opportunities, withholding important information from you, or keeping you out of the loop on matters that are crucial to your job performance. Isolation can also be used by a manipulative person as a form of punishment if you are not doing what he wants. For example, an abusive person might invite all your friends and acquaintances to a gathering, but fail to invite you, so that you feel left out, and you are forced to do what he wants just to score an invite to the next gathering. Positive Reinforcement We always think of positive reinforcement as a good thing, but malicious people can also use it to manipulate their victims. The fact is that we all use positive reinforcement in one form or another. Parents use it to get their kids to behave properly, teachers use it to make their students more interested in school, bosses use it to encourage productivity, and partners use it to modify each other’s behavior in relationships. It is an integral part of our social interactions, but it only becomes a problem when it’s detrimental of the person it’s being used on. Positive reinforcement happens when a good or desirable stimulus is presented in such a way that it appears to be a consequence of certain behavior. For example, a child who eats his vegetables gets a scoop of ice- cream at the end of the meal, and it registers in his mind that those two things are intricately linked. An employee who works hard and becomes more productive gets a bonus at the end of the month, and her brain makes the connection between the hard work and the extra disposable income. The next time the person has to perform the same activity, he/she will recall the positive feeling or the reward from earlier and will take a course of action that ensures he/she gets a similar outcome. When manipulators use positive reinforcements, they are always trying to get you to do things that benefit them. For example, an abusive person in a relationship may buy you a gift after a major abusive incident in order to keep you from leaving or reporting him. You may have heard of people who hit their spouses and then buy them flowers the next day. In such cases, the abuser is trying to get you to accept the abuse as a norm that comes with a reward. The message here is that "if you shut up, you get something nice." Positive reinforcement is also used by manipulators who want you to be their accomplice when they are taking advantage of a third party. Machiavellians are particularly good at using this technique. For example, a boss who embezzles from work may offer you a payoff to keep his secret. Manipulators often use positive reinforcement on an incremental basis when they want you to do something against your will. The objective here is to lull you into complacency. They know that once you have accepted a basic level of positive reinforcement, they can escalate things and push you outside of your comfort zone. The simplest and most commonly used form of positive reinforcement is a commendation. When someone goes out of their way to compliment you in public, they could be using positive reinforcement to manipulate you. For instance, when you are with a group of friends and one of them starts saying what a nice guy you are, how much they know they can rely on you, the chances are that he is buttering you up to ask you for a favor. Negative Reinforcement Negative reinforcement is a form of psychological manipulation which is used to make people feel obligated to act in certain ways in order to avoid certain levels of mental or physical pain or discomfort. In positive reinforcement, you get a reward for acting the way the manipulator wants you to act, and the desire for that reward is what modifies your behavior in the future. Negative reinforcement is, however, a bit more complicated than that. To understand the concept of negative reinforcement, you first have to understand how it’s different from punishment. Both of them are popular manipulation techniques, but there is a subtle difference between them. Many people assume that they are the same thing, but they are not. In punishment, the manipulator adds something negative when you don't act a certain way. In negative reinforcement, the manipulator subtracts something negative when you act the way they want you to act. Reinforcement is meant to strengthen voluntary responses, while punishment is meant to weaken voluntary responses; the manipulator will choose one method or the other based on the kind of outcome that they desire in that particular situation. While punishment is meant to stop a certain behavior from occurring again, reinforcement is meant to encourage the behavior to occur again. A manipulator would use punishment to stop you from doing something he doesn’t want you to do. However, he will use negative reinforcement to force you to do (or to keep doing) something he wants. For example, nagging is more of a negative reinforcement technique than a punishment. When someone wants you to do something, they keep nagging you to do it, and the nagging (which is the negative stimulus) stops when you comply. So, negative reinforcement works on you because you want to put a stop to a negative stimulus that already exists, while punishment works because you want to keep something negative from happening. Every time someone does something negative to twist your arm to get you to take a certain course of action; that is negative reinforcement. When you are trying to break up with someone, and he/she cries very loudly about it in a public place, until you change your mind, they are using negative reinforcement to manipulate you (at that moment, you feel that the uncomfortable stares from strangers will only stop if you take the person back). Sanctions are also a very common form of negative reinforcement. They are used by powerful nations to get other nations to bend to their will, but they can also be used in interpersonal relationships or at work in one form or another. A sanction is basically a threat of a future consequence if you fail to do something. Sanctions may be used in relationships for the common good or for malicious intentions; you have to assess the individual situation to tell if the use of sanctioning (or any other negative reinforcement technique) is malicious. Punishment In psychological manipulation, punishment is a negative action that is taken by the manipulator to weaken the victim’s voluntary responses. Punishment works because it makes the victim fear the consequences of going against the will of the manipulator. We have already looked at how punishment differs from negative reinforcement, but we should point out that in some instances, those two can overlap. In this segment, we will take a look at some of the most common types of punishment that people with dark personality traits use to manipulate their victims. Nagging Nagging, also known as pestering or hectoring, is a form of manipulation where one person continuously urges another to do something, despite the other person previously refusing to do it or to agree to do it at a later time. One author famously described nagging as an interaction where one person makes a repeated request while the other person repeatedly ignores that request, and both people become annoyed as the battle of wills escalates. Although it has negative connotations, nagging is actually an integral part of interpersonal communication in many social dynamics. Parents nag their kids to get them to do certain things. In fact, nagging is necessary when training children to take up certain constructive habits. Nagging may also be used by well-meaning people; friends or partners may nag you to do things that benefit you. In fact, some amount of nagging is necessary even in healthy relationships. However, people with dark personality traits may nag you to do things that benefit them and impact you negatively. To tell if the person nagging you has malicious intentions, you have to examine the individual situation. Are they asking you to do something that only benefits them? Does the nagging seem forceful? Do you detect anger or threats in their body language and in the words they choose to use? Are they trying to guilt you into doing something you don’t want to do? If your girlfriend repeatedly asks you to take out the trash, that might indicate that she has some control issues, but that’s not the same thing as having malicious intentions. When malicious people nag you, there is usually an “or else” to what they are asking you to do, and if you look at the subtext, you will realize that it’s more of a demand than a request. Yelling Yelling works as a manipulation technique for one simple reason; it makes you feel uncomfortable or afraid to the point that you comply with whatever the manipulator wants you to do. There are two main ways in which manipulators use yelling to manipulate others. People either yell to dominate over you, or to play the victim and to gain your sympathy. Yelling can be used to intimidate someone. When a manipulative person yells at you, he may be trying to intimidate you because you are more likely to do what he wants if you are afraid of them. Manipulative people resort to yelling partly because at that moment; they know that they are unable to make a logical argument to get you to do what they want. They know that if you stick to the facts of the matter, you might come out on top, so they yell because they want to disorient you and make you lose the argument by default. When a person raises their voice during an argument, it’s a clear sign of rising hostility, but it could also be a sign that they are passionate about the topic of discussion. You have to assess yelling in context to understand if it’s being used to manipulate you. Just like with the other manipulation techniques; you have to look at the person's intent. When manipulators use yelling to play the victim during an interaction, they often (but not always) choose to do it in front of an audience. When a person (particularly one who is perceived to be weaker) yells at you in a public place, by-passers who don’t have the full story of what’s going on will automatically assume that you are on the wrong, and that puts you on the spot. You may be forced to agree with the person’s request just to avoid the judgmental eyes of strangers. Silent treatment The silent treatment works as a manipulation technique because it's a form of love withdrawal. When a person gives you the silent treatment, they are essentially saying, "I’m taking away the love unless you do what I want." It is a form of punishment that is designed to control people, and it's a very popular type of emotional abuse. The silent treatment only works in cases where there is some level of emotional dependency between the two parties (you don't really care if a total stranger gave you the silent treatment). In certain dynamics, the silent treatment can be used to make you feel powerless and invisible; as if you don’t even exist. As social beings, we need the approval and the affection of others to thrive. Even people who are introverted need to have some sort of back and forth with the people in their lives to feel whole. When someone gives you the silent treatment, they deny you that affection, and it can mess with you psychologically, and force you to make certain concessions that you aren't ready to make. So, a manipulator will ask you to do something, and when you say no, he/she will start ignoring you. They won’t respond when you talk to them, and they won’t answer your calls or texts. Some of them may even suddenly vanish from your life or go out of their way to avoid being in the same room with you. The more emotionally involved you are, the higher the chances you will decide that the animosity isn’t worth you standing your ground, and you will find yourself doing what they want. The silent treatment is one of those bad habits that tend to escalate with time in a relationship. If someone uses this technique against you once and it works, they’ll start using it at every turn. Intimidation Intimidation can either be covert or overt, but in either case, it’s used by manipulators to get you to bend to their will out of fear. Overt intimidation is also known as bullying. This is where manipulators make open threats to get you to do what they want. They’ll use fear to threaten you into submission. It may be a threat of physical violence. They’ll brandish anger and rage to prove to you that they have violent tendencies. If you stand your ground, they may even resort to actual physical violence. They are usually angry people who have problems with authority. Covert intimidation involves the use of veiled or vague threats to manipulate people. People who use covert intimidation has violent tendencies, but they try to control themselves because society frowns at overt displays of violence. Such people are very dangerous because they are good at hiding their true nature from the rest of the world. These are the kinds of people who abuse their spouses indoors but then present a charismatic character to the rest of the world. People who use convert intimidation tend to be very calculated, and they are good at coming up with diabolical ways of punishing you if you don’t do what they want. Traumatic one-trial learning One-trial learning refers to singular experiences that we encounter, which end up shaping our behavior in the future. This sort of experience is usually traumatizing and powerful enough to serve as a deterrent from acting in a certain way for the rest of our lives. In many cases, one-trial learning may occur without anyone inducing it or imposing it on us. For example, if you try a certain kind of food for the first time, and then you get a serious bout of food poisoning, you may be traumatized to the point that you avoid eating that food again in the future. One-trial learning is important for humans and all animals because it’s crucial for survival. When we were still hunters and foragers, one-trial learning would help us avoid foods that were poisonous or situations that were dangerous. Malicious people use one-trial learning as a manipulation technique to get us to tow certain lines. The way it works is they induce the traumatic experience in such a way as to ensure that our brains associate certain actions with the trauma. One such example is corporal punishment. Corporal punishment is less common in Western societies than it was a few decades back, but it is one of the easiest forms of traumatic one-trial learning to understand. It used to be that when a child did something wrong, the parents (or teachers) would hit him while making it very clear to the child why he was being punished. In future, when the child considered making the same mistake again, he would remember the pain that he experienced earlier, and he would decide that the action was not worth a repetition of the painful experience. Of course, corporal punishment is now either frowned upon or illegal in most jurisdictions because it causes serious psychological wounds and self-esteem issues. Manipulators use traumatic one-trial learning in many different ways. They use verbal abuse, intimidation, and explosive anger to traumatize people and keep them from acting in certain ways in the future. For instance, let’s say that you are in a team with a colleague who isn’t pulling his/her weight on the project you are working on. One day, you decide to confront him about it in a calm and rational way. However, he reacts in a very explosive way. He calls you names, throws a tantrum, causes a scene, and he makes you extremely uncomfortable and traumatized. In the future, when a similar issue arises, you will be afraid to confront him, so he gets away with it. In this case, he has manipulated you by conditioning you to avoid confronting or upsetting him in the future. There are many variations in the way traumatic one-trial learning works, and it’s commonly used to manipulate people in interpersonal relationships. The next time you want to do something, but you decide against it because you had a bad experience in the past, you should know that you are dealing with traumatic one-trial learning; if the situation is tied to a specific person, that should indicate to you that the person is a manipulator. Manipulation of facts Manipulation of facts is one of the most effective psychological manipulation techniques because it is based on facts that are subject to interpretation. When a person manipulates facts, he is technically not lying; he is just using the facts in his favor. It could involve cherry picking facts, omitting certain facts, or taking facts out of context. Even the most indisputable facts are subject to interpretation, and people with dark personality traits are very good at coming up with interpretations that portray them in the best possible light. Machiavellians are especially skilled at using factual information to turn bad things into seemingly good things. One way to manipulate facts in interpersonal relationships is by making excuses. People can excuse all sorts of bad behavior by creating narratives that warp the context of the objectionable actions that they have taken. Another way to manipulate facts is by blaming the victim for causing his/her victimization. There are many documented cases where abusers in relationships were able to convince their victims that they did certain things to deserve the abuse. There are many wife beaters who defend themselves by saying, "you made me do it." This manipulation technique often works more effectively after the victim has been isolated from her support system. Victims who are in love or are dependent on the abuser are more likely to accept warped interpretations of abusive events because their own judgment is impaired by their affection for the abuser. Withholding of key information, or strategic disclosure of facts, is another common technique that involves manipulation of facts. Someone might be telling you the truth with the intention of manipulation you. Manipulators know that your reaction to certain information depends on the mood you are in when you receive the information, or whether or not you will consider that information a priority at the moment you receive it. Manipulators also know that hiding certain key details can affect the way you digest and react to information. Strategic disclosures and withholding of key details are used every day in interpersonal relationships, in business, and even in political discourse. Politicians use this all the time. When they have information that could damage their standing with the public, but they have a legal obligation to release it, they often do it at the close of business on Friday, when most people are looking forward to the weekend, and they aren’t paying attention to the news. This way, they ensure the damaging information doesn’t get a lot of media coverage. Other ways to manipulate facts include; exaggeration of the facts, sensationalizing or the facts, understating facts, or presenting facts with one- sided biases. Everyone uses all of these techniques to some extent; you have to examine each person’s intent to determine whether or not they are malicious. Mind control and mind games The term mind control has many definitions and interpretations, but the crucial thing to note is that it doesn't involve any sort of magic or supernatural ability; it just requires a rudimentary understanding of human emotions and behavior. Mind control can involve brainwashing a person, reeducating them, reforming their thoughts, using coercive techniques to persuade them of certain things, or brain-sweeping. There are many forms of mind control, and we could fill an entire book discussing all those forms, but for our purposes, we will look at the concept in general terms. Mind control means a person is trying to get others to feel, think, or behave in a certain way, or to react and make decisions following a certain pattern. It could vary from a girl trying to get her boyfriend to develop certain habits, to a cult leader trying to convince his followers that he is God. Mind control is based on one thing: information. We have the thoughts and beliefs that we do because we learned them. When we are subjected to new information on a deliberate and consistent basis, it’s possible to alter our beliefs, thoughts, or even memories. The brain is hardwired to survive, and towards that end, it’s very good at learning information that is crucial for our survival. When you receive certain information consistently, your brain will start to believe it even if you know it’s not true. For example, even if you are the most rational person out there, if you go online and watch 100 videos about a certain conspiracy theory, you will start to believe it to some extent. That explains why people who seem smart can end up getting indoctrinated into cults or even terrorist groups. Mind control also works more effectively when one is dependent on the person who is trying to control his/her mind. Even in relationships that are involuntary, the victim can start buying the perpetrator’s world view if they have been dependent on the perpetrator for a long time. That explains phenomena such as Stockholm syndrome (where people who are kidnapped or held hostage start being affectionate towards their captors and empathizing with their causes). The worst thing you can do is assume that you are too smart for mind control to work on you. Under the right circumstances, anyone can be persuaded to abandon their world view and adopt someone else's. Mind games are covert tricks that are deliberately crafted in order to manipulate someone. Think of them as "handcrafted" psychological manipulation techniques. While other techniques are applied broadly, mind games are created to target very specific people. They work best when the victim trusts the perpetrator, and the perpetrator understands the victim’s personality and behavior. Most of the psychological manipulation techniques we have discussed thus far can be used when crafting mind games. A person who understands you will tell you certain things or behave in certain ways around you because they are deliberately trying to get you to react in a certain way. It almost always involves feigning certain emotions. People who play mind games use innocent sounding communication to elicit calculated reactions from you. Psychologists refer to such mind games as “conscious one-upmanship," and they have observed that they occur in all areas of life. Mind games occur in office politics, personal relationships, and even in international diplomacy. At work, someone could try to make you feel like you are not up to the task so that they can steal an opportunity from you. In a marriage, your partner could make certain seemingly innocent slights against you so that you feel like you have something to prove, and you take a certain course of action as a result. In dating, there are “pickup artists” who use different kinds of tricks to get you to lower your guard and let them in. Chapter 4: Behavioral and Character Traits of the Manipulators Being able to tell if someone is taking advantage of you or manipulating you is one of the most important survival skills that you need today. Everyone around you has their own interests and agendas, but it’s crucial to be able to tell when those agendas are malicious or likely to cause you unintended harm. Manipulators have many identifiable behavioral and character traits, some of which we will discuss in this chapter. With the information you learn here, you will be able to tell whether or not a person is a manipulator, whether or not his/her brand of manipulation is meant to cause you harm, and what kind of manipulator he/she is. Here are the character and behavioral traits that you ought to look out for if you suspect that someone is a manipulator. Lying by the commission and lying by omission A lie of commission is what's called a "classic lie." When someone says something that they know is not factual, then that is a lie of commission. In other words, a lie of commission is something that is simply untrue. It involves purposefully telling someone something with the intention of deceiving them. It is extremely deliberate, and its main purpose is to gain a personal advantage in a given situation. Lying by the commission isn’t always done with malicious intent, but people who are more comfortable telling outright lies are more likely to be manipulators. Everyone lies. Even seemingly innocent young children will tell a lie of commission to get out of trouble; a child with jam on his face will deny touching it because he is trying to evade the consequences of telling the truth, not because he is malicious. When you spend time with a manipulator, you will notice that he lies all the time out of habit, even when the situation doesn’t necessitate it. Narcissists will lie because they want you to think highly of them, while sadists will lie to cause you pain. Lies of the commission may seem pointless to you in specific situations, but they always have a certain value for the manipulator, even if you aren’t able to see it. Lying by omission is also known as "exclusionary detailing." It involves telling the truth but leaving out certain specific details. It may also involve failing to correct certain misconceptions that one is aware of. Lies of omission are more sophisticated than lies of commission because they give the person a loophole in case they are caught on the lie. Even in legal situations, it’s possible to get away with lies of omission, because you can always argue that the person asking the questions wasn’t specific enough about what details they wanted you to give. The first and most common instance of lying by omission is the kind that involves leaving out details. The best example of such a lie is when a salesperson talks about the positive aspects of a product but fails to mention its negative aspects. Manipulators can use lies of omission to control the way people react in certain situations. For example, when a malicious person reports to you what a mutual friend said about you in an earlier conversation, they may choose to mention the details that are likely to breed animosity between you and your friend but leave out the redeeming details. If someone said three things about you; two compliments and one critical comment, the malicious person will report the critical comment to you and deliberately fail to mention the two positive comments. Failing to correct misconceptions is a less common kind of lie of omission, and it’s mostly used by diabolical Machiavellians and psychopaths. This is where a person lets you believe a certain thing even when they know it’s not true. For example, if you blame yourself for a situation that the other person knows isn’t your fault, they’ll let you keep believe it because it benefits them. Experienced manipulators may say things or act in ways that lead you to arrive at a certain false conclusion, and when you get there, they let you keep believing it. Lying by omission can be used to trick or confuse people into making assumptions that benefit manipulators. Manipulators understand that the human mind tends to jump to conclusions, so they often use cues that lead you to those conclusions. Conmen use this technique all the time to gain the trust of unsuspecting victims. For example, if you are sitting in the hospital waiting room and someone walks up to you wearing a lab coat, you will assume that the person is a doctor even before he starts talking to you. In that case, you would have come to a reasonable conclusion based on the context. Manipulators know that you have the inclination to do that so they'll create the right context to make you jump to the conclusion that they want. Once you are at that conclusion, they'll let you keep believing it, and they’ll exploit you. Denial When you say that someone is in denial, it often means that they are having a difficult time accepting reality. However, denial takes on a whole deferent meaning where manipulators are concerned. Manipulators use denial to feign innocence when they know full well that they have done something wrong. Manipulators use denial to control other people’s impressions of who they are and interpretations of the things they did. Some manipulators are so good when it comes to using denial that they are able to get people to start second- guessing themselves. Denial is a crucial behavioral trait in predicting whether or not a person is likely to gaslight you. If in the early stages of a relationship, your partner blatantly denies something you both know to be true, you can rest assured that he is the kind of person who will be gaslighting you for years to come. When manipulators are confronted and put on a spot, they might use denial to save face. This is fairly easy to conceive; the person doesn't want to admit the truth, so they deny it. But with some people with dark personality traits (especial the psychopaths), denial goes beyond that. When ordinary people use denial, do it to deceive you. However, when some disturbed individuals use denial, they do it to deceive both you and themselves. This is a particularly dangerous trait because it could mean the person completely lacks a conscious. For instance, if a person causes you harm, and he denies doing it to get you off his back, that's one thing. But if he denies it because he truly believes there is nothing wrong with what he did, then you are dealing with a dangerous psychopath. Denial also indicates that the person you are dealing with is unwilling to change his behavior. In as much as he is manipulating you as he would using other techniques, denial implies that the person feels justified, and he won’t hesitate to do the exact same thing again in the future. They say that accepting a mistake is the first step towards correcting it. If a person can’t accept a mistake he has made, it means he is nowhere near the path to fixing it. If you meet a person (whether at work or in your personal life), and you notice that he habitually denies things about him that are objective facts, it means that you are dealing with a rigid person who would go out of his way to make sure things go his way even if it means refusing to accept the truth. Denial can be a defense mechanism, a manipulation tactic, or a way to avoid taking responsibility. In any case, people who use it can cause serious damage to your psyche, so watch out for them. Rationalization Rationalization is similar to making excuses. Manipulative people are very skilled when it comes to concocting narratives that justify the way they treat other people. When you confront a manipulator, even with the most damning accusation, he will come up with a well-thought-out and rather convincing explanation for his actions. When ordinary people rationalize or make excuses for their actions, you get the sense that even though they are trying to assuage their conscience, they feel guilty and they are even apologetic about what they have done. However, when manipulators rationalize their actions, they are trying to manage the way you perceive them, and they feel justified in their actions. Most people use rationalization as a defense mechanism, or to make the actions they have done or are about to do seems morally tolerable. Whenever rationalization is used, there is a certain “leap” that is taken by the person who is using it. The larger the leap, the higher the person is likely to score when tested for dark psychological traits. For example, a person who rationalizes taking $20 from the office petty cash box for personal use may be a bit narcissistic, but a person who rationalizes embezzling $20 million from the company retirement accounts may have extremely high levels of narcissism, Machiavellianism or even psychopathy. Like with all other traits that are common in the entire population, the motivation behind the rationalization has a bearing on whether or not the person doing it has malicious intentions. When you encounter someone who rationalizes things that are clearly wrong, you have to examine what it is they are rationalizing to tell how they feel about certain principles. Even if you are having a hypothetical conversation with someone, you can learn a lot about their attitudes towards certain things by the way they rationalize them. For example, if you confront someone you’ve just met who behaves in a belligerent way, and he consistently comes up with ways to excuse that behavior, it could mean that he is the kind of person who believes in the principle that bullying is acceptable. It means that it’s just a matter of time before he turns around and starts bullying you. If you are in a new relationship, you should take a keen interest in the things your partner is willing to justify. One thing many people fail to understand is that if you hear someone close to you justify something and you don’t object to it on principle, it registers in his mind that you are okay with it, and it becomes part of your social contract with him. That means that a person who rationalizes small things won’t hesitate to rationalize bigger things if the same basic principle applies. Minimization Minimization involves trivializing a person’s emotions or actions for the purposes of manipulation. It often combines elements of denial and rationalization; it’s somewhere in between those two characteristics. When a manipulative person can’t completely deny something, and he can’t completely rationalize it either, he will settle for minimizing it. Manipulators downplay the significance of certain events or emotions all the time. The emotions or actions that they downplay could either be yours, theirs, or those of a third party, as long as it serves their purposes. If you have accomplished something significant, a manipulative person may try to belittle or to discount that achievement. A narcissistic person may try to make your contribution to a team effort seem like its "no big deal," even if it was pivotal to the success of a project you are working on together. In a relationship, your partner may trivialize your emotions and make them seem insignificant. If you react emotionally to something they have done or said, they may say that you are too sensitive, and you are making a big deal out of nothing, or that you are immature. Both male and female manipulators can have this character trait. A man could say that a woman is a "drama queen" for "overreacting" and a woman could accuse a man of being "unmanly" for expressing strong emotions. Minimization often works on people because it makes them feel self- conscious. If someone accuses you of blowing things out of proportion, you are likely to take a step back to see if you are overreacting. Abusers also use minimization to make it seem as though their actions aren’t as harmful as the victim claims. A physically abusive spouse could say that he "didn't hit you that hard" and an emotionally abusive one could get a rise out of you and then say that you are "just being a big baby." In both cases, the person minimizes the harm they have caused by arguing that it could have been much worse. In their minds, they think they deserve credit for holding back. Another common aspect of minimization is called "cognitive distortion." This is where a person minimizes certain actions or emotions by making it seem as though they are not that important, or by trying to reduce the perception of the impact of those emotions and actions. For example, a person may insult or taunt you, but when you confront him about it, he may try to say that it was just a joke and that you should get a sense of humor. Cognitive distortion also happens at institutional levels. For example, institutions that have systemic problems always claim that they have “a few bad apples” instead of acknowledging that there is a big-picture problem that needs to be addressed. You should be very careful with people who use minimization in manipulation because this behavior has a tendency of escalating. Diversion and Evasion Evasion and diversion are used by manipulators to keep the spotlight away from their manipulative behavior. These tactics also help them to avoid being exposed for who they are, and they keep them from having to take responsibility for what they are doing. Evasion involves providing rambling or irrelevant feedback in a situation that demands direct responses. When manipulative people are asked direct questions, they start talking about vaguely related things that aren’t even relevant to the conversation. A person who uses evasion will try to avoid giving a straight answer to a question that you have asked them. On the other hand, a person who uses diversion will change the topic or steer the conversation in a whole other direction. Diversion involves avoiding a topic by bringing up a different topic, especially one that is likely to spark outrage. For example, if you are in a relationship and you ask your partner a question about why they have come home late, the evasive ones will start talking in detail about random topics such as things that happened at work, which have nothing to do with what you want to know. The person who uses diversion, on the other hand, will bring up an unresolved issue, and they may even try to turn things around on you. Instead of telling your where he was, he will reignite an argument you had put on hold, and a few minutes later, you will find yourself arguing about your mother, with no idea how the conversation got there. Politicians use diversion and evasion all the time when they don’t want to address certain issues, and they would rather have the public outraged about something else. Politicians are very masterful when it comes to turning any line of questioning into a discussion about a talking point that they have. There are also other professions where evasion and diversion are considered useful techniques. Lawyers and PR managers use it to keep their clients from being closely scrutinized in public. Evasion and diversion mostly work on victims who have problems being assertive. When a manipulator finds that you keep insisting on getting a straight answer despite his best efforts to avoid providing it, he may resort to other techniques. Evasion and diversion are clear signs of deception. They often mean that the person is hiding something, and he doesn’t want to go on record, so he goes out of his way to avoid giving a real answer to your question. Covert intimidation and guilt tripping Covert intimidation and guilt tripping use the same underlying principle; they prey on a person’s emotions. Covert intimidation preys on fear, while guilt tripping preys on compassion. People who use these techniques have what psychologists refer to as covert-aggressive personalities. They are "wolves in sheep's clothing." They present one face to the world, while deep within, they are very malicious people. Covert intimidation involves threatening victims in subtle ways. It can be used by people who are close to you if they understand your fears or desires. Your boss could use covert intimidation to get you to do his bidding at work. If he knows that you are working towards a promotion, he could ask you to do him certain favors, and then imply that your promotion is dependent on that favor. He may not say it directly, but it’s all going to be in the subtext. If you are afraid of ending up alone, an abusive partner may play on that fear to manipulate you. For example, if you want to break up with someone who is emotionally selfish, he could keep implying that you will never meet someone else and that he is your only chance of not being lonely. Guilt tripping is used by manipulators to get people to doubt themselves, to be anxious, to revere the manipulators, or to do certain favors for the manipulators. People can guilt trip you by making themselves appear like victims, or by making you appear to be selfish. When you are accused of being selfish, you are likely to go out of your way to prove that you are not, and manipulative people can take advantage of this. For example, if you are dating someone and she wants you to buy her something expensive, or to do her a favor that is going to cost you, you'll try to explain as plainly as possible that you are unable to do it. She may then say something like, "you just don't care about me enough." When she says this, even the most rational argument you make won’t matter. There is a bottom- line in place here; that you value keeping your money more than you value her happiness. Guilt trips work because they are not based on objective reasoning; they are based on emotions (which are more primal and rank higher in the hierarchy of brain functions). When you care about someone, and you feel a sense of obligation towards them, then they have the power to take you on a guilt trip. That means that for a manipulator to guilt-trip you, they are going to make sure that you have some emotional connection with them. If you are in a new relationship, you should watch out to see if your partner likes to take his/her friends and family members on guilt trips, because it could mean that you will be subjected to the same treatment once you are emotionally involved. Shaming Shame refers to the uncomfortable feeling of distress or humiliation, which results when we are conscious of certain behavior that we consider to be wrong or foolish. The thing to understand about shame is that it’s a social construct, and it’s highly subjective. You’d feel shame if the wind blew up your skirt in a public place, but there are remote tribes of people and even communes in Western societies where people walk around naked. The point is that most shameful things are only shameful because we perceive them as such. Manipulators can use shame against you by either convincing you to be ashamed of something that you weren’t, or by revealing (or threatening to reveal) your secrets to people who revere you. Traditionally, shaming is used as a deterrent to make people adhere to social contracts or to teach children the proper way to behave. Malicious people shame people in many different ways, often to their own benefit. They shame people by calling them names, expressing disgust in response to others' ideas, emotions, and behavior, using sarcasm, rolling their eyes, or exposing their secrets. A malicious person shames others to bring them down and to elevate themselves. They can do this because they want to distract people from their own inadequacies. A sadist may shame you because he enjoys it when you are uncomfortable. A narcissist may shame you just to show others that he is smarter than you. A Machiavellian may shame you because he wants to modify your behavior to his advantage. Shaming is somewhat similar to guilt-tripping, but shaming tends to play out in the public arena. Shaming works more effectively when there are people whose opinion you value who are involved. Malicious people know that there are certain things you don't want people to find out about you, even if you are comfortable with them in principle. "Slut shaming" is one example. "Revenge porn" is an even more extreme example. When you are in a relationship with a malicious person, and you try to get out of it, they may use these techniques to either get you to stay or to punish you for leaving them. Vilifying the victim Manipulators, especially Machiavellians, tend to be smart and devious, so they can easily find ways to vilify their victims. There are two ways that this can happen; they can either convince other people that the victim is the real aggressor, or they can convince the victim that he/she is the one who did something wrong. Vilifying the victim involves using several tactics, including rationalizing, and gaslighting. People who vilify victims try to justify their actions by making it seem as though the victims are the "bad guys." For example, someone who cheats on his spouse may explain his behavior away by telling people that his spouse is a "bitch," or she is "frigid" and "controlling." The manipulator is trying to rationalize his actions here by creating the impression that whatever he may have done, the person he did it too, had it coming, and she probably deserved worse. You can tell if a person you have started seeing has a tendency to blame the victim by assessing the way he/she talks about his/her past relationships. If he blames everything that went wrong on his ex and takes no responsibility whatsoever for his role in what happened, you can be certain that he’ll approach your relationship the same way. Manipulative people know deep within that they are responsible for the things that go wrong, but to them, vilifying the victim is just another way to be deceptive and to control the way people perceive them. If they are vilifying you, they want you to take responsibility for their actions so that they can dominate you. Narcissists tend to believe that they are superior to other people, and when they vilify the victim, they may truly believe that its within their right to take advantage of you however they can; it’s not that they don’t know they are taking advantage of you, they just think that you are subservient to them and that’s just the natural order of things. Playing the victim role, and playing the servant role When manipulators play the role of the victim, in actual sense, they never really see themselves as victims. It’s just a game for them, and the point is to avoid responsibility while getting the benefits that come with sympathy. They want to be perceived as weak people who are suffering, emotionally wounded, or even physically injured for the purposes of eliciting sympathy or managing impressions. Manipulators try to convince their victims that they are the ones who are suffering in one way or another. If the victim is invested in the manipulator’s welfare, he/she may decide to offer help, often at a high personal cost. You should be extremely cautious if you realize that you are dealing with a person who likes to play the victim because you never know how far they may go. If someone plays the victim in any dynamic, someone else has to be cast as a victimizer, and if the manipulator is good at it, he/she could come up with a very well-constructed narrative that could irreversibly ruin your reputation or even put you in legal jeopardy. If someone you are dating plays the victim when the two of you are together, it might be possible to deal with the issue by seeking counseling. However, if you notice that he/she is selling that narrative to other people, you should try to get out of that relationship as fast as possible before the lie escalates and everyone turns against you. Playing the servant role refers to a manipulative trait where a person pretends to be doing something for a noble cause or to serve someone else when they are actually cloaking a self-serving agenda. This is common in Machiavellians and psychopaths, but not so much in narcissists. A Machiavellian may pretend to be on your side, and he may offer to do your bidding. He may even give you plenty of reasons to trust him, and you may let him in and give him access to your resources. Sooner or later, he will reveal his true intentions; often time, it could be that he has a desire for power or control, and to him, you are just in the way. Machiavellians are good at hiding their ambitions, but when the opportunity arises, they'll strike, and they'll exert their dominance over you. There are manipulators who get into leadership positions by playing the servant role. They then go on to use those leadership positions for personal enrichment, or for their own agendas. You may have heard of people who start charities and prey on conscientious and well-meaning people to collect donations, which they proceed to embezzle. Seduction Seduction is an integral part of romance and courtship, but it can also be a very effective manipulation tactic if a person has malicious intentions. We all want to be liked and to be valued, so when someone says flattering things about us, we are likely to believe them. Seduction is one of the first manipulation techniques that most manipulators will deploy when they meet you for the first time. As we have mentioned several times already, manipulation techniques tend to be more effective when the manipulator and the victim have some sort of emotional connection; seduction is the first step towards establishing that connection. Seduction and flattery are insidious ways of managing impressions when manipulators want to conceal their true intentions. When someone gives you attention, you feel special and flattered, and you let your guard down, allowing him to come in and take advantage of you. We all have some level of narcissism inside of us, so when someone flatters us, we rarely stop to think that maybe they have an ulterior motive and that the flattery has nothing to do with us. Even when people are aware that they are being buttered up, they often let it happen, and they don’t put a stop to it. They start off by assuming that they are immune to the manipulator’s charms, and they tell themselves that they are indulging the person just for fun, but before they realize it, the end up actually falling for the trick and becoming emotionally invested in the manipulator. Manipulators don't pull any stops when they are seducing their victims. They present themselves very well, and they use every trick in the book to win over their victims. Depending on the manipulator's dominant dark trait, after getting what they want, they may either reveal their true nature, or they may continue to make efforts to conceal it. By the time the victim knows what’s going on, it would probably be too late. Projecting the blame Playing the blame game is one of the most defining characteristics of manipulators. They like to project blame on others because it keeps others from blaming them, and as a result, they are able to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. Projecting blame on a person forces him to go on the defensive, and this serves as a distraction. Such people always claim that it was another person or a circumstance that caused them to do something wrong. Psychologists call this tactic "projection." In ordinary people, projection is an automatic mental behavior that is well documented in research concerning psychodynamic psychology. People can unconsciously project their intentions, motivations, or actions on others if they are feeling guilty or unnerved under the prevailing circumstances. However, after that initial subconscious reaction, most people will do the logical thing and admit to themselves that the projection is mistaken. People with dark personality traits, on the other hand, will stick with the projection even if they know that they are the ones who are truly responsible for a negative outcome. Sadists will not only project their mistakes onto you, but they will also go out of their way to make you feel bad about it. Narcissists, Machiavellians, and psychopaths are especially good at projecting blame on others because they don't feel guilt and shame the way most people do. When an ordinary person projects blame on someone else, he will have to deal with a high level of cognitive dissonance, which means that he would be torn up inside. Manipulators, on the other hand, will rationalize their projections; for example, Machiavellians will just see it as a means to an end. The more tactful manipulators can pass blame in a more subtle way by spreading it around rather than just projecting it onto one entity. For example, when they do something wrong, and you call them out on it, they will bring to your attention a whole list of "contributing circumstances" with the intention of obscuring or minimizing their role in creating the problem under discussion. Brandishing anger Malicious people use anger to manipulate people all the time. When someone brandishes anger at you, they may yell, or use threatening gestures, spit out harsh words, or react in totally unpredictable ways. People’s emotions have an effect on how we act and react in specific situations, so manipulative people can strategically deploy anger to control the way you react. It could be that they want you to be afraid of them so that you refrain from asking prying questions. No one wants to be yelled at, so if someone is angry at you, it incentivizes you to drop the issue you are raising. Manipulative people also brandish anger to convey fake moral outrage in order to portray themselves as innocent in the face of damning accusations. For example, if you suspect your partner of cheating on you and confront him about it, if he is manipulative, he may react very angrily to show you that he is outraged that you would even ask him about such a thing. Brandishing anger also makes manipulative people feel superior to those around them. A boss who yells at his subordinates may be doing it to show that he is in control, that he knows more than everyone else, and that he wants people to do things his way out of fear. Abusive partners do the same thing when they want to put their spouses or girlfriends under their thumbs. Chapter 5: What is Covert Emotional Manipulation? Covert emotional manipulation is used by people who want to gain power or control over you by deploying tactics that are both deceptive and underhanded. Such people want to change the way you think and behave without you ever realizing what it is they are doing. In other words, they use techniques that can alter your perceptions in such a way that you think that you are doing it out of your own free will. Covert emotional manipulation is “covert” because it works without you being consciously aware of that fact. People who are good at deploying such techniques can get you to do their bidding without your knowledge; they can hold you “psychologically captive." When skilled manipulators set their sights on you, they can get you to grant them power over your own emotional well-being and even your self-worth. They will put you under their spell without you ever realizing it. They will win your trust, and you will start attaching value to what they think of you. Once you have let them into your life, they will then start chipping away at your very identity in a methodical way, and as time goes by you will lose your self-esteem and turn into whatever they want you to be. Covert emotional manipulation is actually more common than you might think. Since it's subtle, people are rarely aware that it’s happening to them, and in some cases, they may never even notice. Only keen outside observers may be able to tell when this form of manipulation is going on. You might know someone who used to be fun and jovial, then she got into a relationship with someone else, and a few years down the line, she seems to have a completely different personality. If it’s an old friend, you might not even recognize the person she has become. That is how powerful covert emotional manipulation can be. It can completely overhaul someone’s personality without them even realizing it. The manipulator will chip away at you little by little, and you will accept minute changes that fly under the radar, until the old you are replaced by a different version of you, build to be subservient to the manipulator. Covert emotional manipulation works like a slow-moving coup. It requires you to make small progressive concessions to the person that is trying to manipulate you. In other words, you let go of tiny aspects of your identity to accommodate the manipulative person, so it never registers in your mind that there is something bigger at play. When the manipulative person pushes you to change in small ways, you will comply because you don't want to "sweat the small stuff." However, there is a domino effect that occurs as you start conceding to the manipulative person. You will be more comfortable making subsequent concessions, and your personality will be erased and replaced in a cumulative progression. Covert emotional manipulation occurs to some extent in all social dynamics. Let’s look at how it plays out in romantic relationships, in friendships, and at work. Emotional manipulation in relationships There is a lot of emotional manipulation that takes place in romantic relationships, and it’s not always malicious. For example, women try to modify men’s behavior to make them more “housebroken"; that is just normal. However, there are certain instances of manipulation where the person's intention is clearly malicious, and he/she is motivated by a need to control or dominate over the other person. Positive reinforcement is perhaps the most used covert manipulation technique in romantic relationships. Your partner can get you to do what he wants by praising your, flattering you, giving you attention, offering your gifts, and acting in an affectionate way. Even the seemingly nice things in relationships can turn out to be covert manipulation tools and props. For instance, your girlfriend could use intense sex as a weapon to reinforce a certain kind of behavior in you. Similarly, men can use charm, appreciation, or gifts to reinforce certain behaviors in the women they are dating. Some sophisticated manipulators use what psychologists call “intermittent positive reinforcement” to gain control over their partners. The way it works is that the perpetrator will shower the victim with intense positive reinforcement for a certain period of time, then switch to just giving her normal levels of attention and appreciations. After a random interval of time, he will again go back to the intense positive reinforcement. When the victim gets used to the special treatment, it’s taken away, and when she gets used to normal treatment, the special treatment is brought back, and it all seems arbitrary. Now, the victim will get to a place where she becomes sort of “addicted” to the special treatment, but she has no idea how to get it, so she starts doing whatever the perpetrator wants in the hope that one of the things she does will bring back the intense positive reinforcement. In other words, she effectively becomes subservient to the perpetrator. Negative reinforcement techniques are also used in relationships to manipulate others covertly. For example, partners can withhold sex as a way of compelling the other person to modify their behavior in a specific way. People also use techniques such as the silent treatment, and withholding of love and affection. Some malicious people can create a false sense of intimacy by pretending to open up to you. They could share personal stories and talk about their hopes and fears. When they do this, they create the impression that they trust you, but their intention may be to get you to feel a sense of obligation towards them. Manipulators also use well-calculated insinuations to get you to react in a certain way at the moment, with the aim of modifying your behavior in the long run. Such insinuations can be made through words or even actions. In colloquial terms, we call this "dropping a hint." People in relationships are always trying to figure out what the other person wants out of that relationship, so a manipulative person can drop hints to get you to do what they want without ever having to take responsibility for the actions that you take because they can always argue that you misinterpreted what they meant. Dropping hints isn’t always malicious (for example, if your girlfriend wants you to propose, she may leave bridal magazines out on the table). However, malicious insinuations can be very hurtful, and they can chip away at your self-esteem. Your partner can insinuations to suggest you are gaining weight, you aren’t making enough money, or even to suggest that your cooking skills aren’t any good. People use insinuations to get away with "saying without saying," any number of hurtful things that could affect your self-esteem. Emotional manipulations in friendships Covert emotional manipulation is quite common in friendships and casual relationships. Friendships tend to progress slower than romantic relationships, but that just means that it can take a lot more time for you to figure out if your friends are manipulative. Manipulation in friendships can be confusing because even well-meaning friends can come across as malicious. That's because there is a certain social rivalry that exists between even the closest of friends, which explain the concept of "frenemies." Manipulative friends tend to be passive-aggressive. This is where they manipulate you into doing what they want by involving mutual friends rather than by coming to you directly. Passive aggression works as a manipulation technique because it denies you a chance of directly addressing whatever issue your friend is raising, and so in a manner of speaking, you lose by default. For example, if a friend wants you to do her a favor, instead of coming out and asking you, she goes to a mutual friend and suggests that she asks you on her behalf. Now, when the mutual friend approaches you, it becomes very difficult for you to turn down the request because there is added social pressure. When you say no, your whole social circle now perceives you as selfish. Passive aggression can also involve the use of silent treatment to get you to comply with a request. Imagine a situation where one of your friends talks to everyone else but you. It’s going to be incredibly awkward for you, and everyone will start prying, wondering what the issue is between the two of you, and taking sides on the matter. Friends can also covertly manipulate you by using subtle insults. They can give you back-handed compliments which have hidden meanings. When you take the time to really think about what they meant by the compliment, you will realize that it’s an insult in disguise, and that will bruise your self- esteem, and possibly modify your behavior. Some friends can manipulate you by going on a “power trip” and trying to control your social interactions. For example, there are those friends who are going to insist that every time you hang out, it should be in their apartment, or at a social venue of their choosing. Such friends often have the intention of dominating your friendship, so they are keen to always have the “home ground advantage” over you. They’ll try to push you out of your comfort zone, just so that you can reveal your weaknesses and you can then become more emotionally reliant on them. Manipulative friends tend to excessively capitalize on your friendship, and to a disproportionate degree. They will ask you for lots of favors with no regard for your time or your effort. They are the kinds of friends who will leverage your friendship every time they need something, but then make excuses when it’s their turn to reciprocate. Emotional manipulation at work There are many reasons why your colleague may want to manipulate you. It could be you are on the same career path, and so he wants to make you look bad. It could be that he is lazy and he wants to stick you with his responsibilities. It could also be that he is a sadist and he just wants to see you suffer. One-way people at work exert their dominance over others is by stressing them out and then, almost immediately, relieving the stress. Say, for example, you make a minor error on a report, and your boss calls you into his office. He makes a big fuss and threatens to fire you, but then towards the end, he switches gears and reassures you that your job is secure as long as you do what he wants. That kind of manipulation works on people because it makes them afraid and gives them a sense of obligation at the same time. Some colleagues can manipulate you by doing you small favors, and then reminding you of those favors every time they want something from you. For instance, if you made an error at work and a colleague covered for you, he may hold it over your head for months or even years to come, and he is going to guilt you into feeling indebted to him. Colleagues can also manipulate you by leaving you out of the loop when they are passing across important information. The intention here is to get you to mess up so that they can have a better standing with the boss or with other colleagues. When you discover that someone is leaving you out of the loop at work and you confront them, they could feign innocence and pretend that it was a genuine mistake on their part, or they could find a way to turn it around and blame you. People with dark personality traits tend to be hyper-competitive at work, and they won’t hesitate to use underhanded means to pull one over you. Most colleagues turn out to be good friends, but you should be careful with colleagues that are overly eager to befriend you. It could be that they want to learn more about you so that they can figure out your strengths and weaknesses, and find ways to use them against you. Narcissist, Machiavellians, and psychopaths are very good at scheming at work, so don’t let them catch you off guard. Chapter 6: What are the Manipulators Trying to do? You may wonder; what are manipulators trying to do? Why do they put so much work into manipulating others, instead of just focusing on improving themselves? The fact is that manipulators have a deep-seated psychological need to control others, so they seek to "weaken" their victims in order to gain dominance over them. When they manipulate others, they are trying to cancel their willpower, to destroy their self-esteem, to seek passive-aggressive revenge against them, or to confuse their reality so that they become more malleable. Let’s look at how and why manipulators do those four things. Cancellation of willpower It’s because of our willpower that we are able to retain control over our lives and to resist people’s attempts to dominate us and force us to do their bidding. That is why one of the primary intentions of manipulative people is to obliterate our willpower. So, how can someone take away your willpower? Well, first, you have to understand that willpower isn’t unlimited. We can lose our will power through a process that psychologists refer to as "ego depletion." To understand this, you have to think of willpower as a resource that may be renewable, but it can only be renewed at a slow pace. So, if we spend that resource on one thing, we have less of it to spend on another thing that demands it. So, ego depletion is the outcome that occurs when we spend all the willpower that we have, and we are left without adequate willpower in the face of subsequent challenges. Manipulative people know that willpower doesn’t come from a bottomless pit, so they tend to overload us with scenarios where we are forced to use our willpower until that willpower gets depleted. For example, a malicious person may keep trying to agitate you, while you keep trying to stay calm and keep your cool. However, if he keeps doing it for a prolonged period of time, chances are you will get to a point where you snap and react with anger. Psychologists believe that willpower is sort of like a muscle; it gets stronger when you exercise it, but during the moment of exertion, it can fail if it’s pushed past a certain point. Malicious people can cancel your willpower by forcing you to overexert it. Willpower is what’s makes it possible for us to make the right decisions in the face of serious temptation or pressure. It’s what makes us spend time studying for an exam instead of watching videos online. Without willpower, we become highly suggestible, and people can get us to do their bidding with little resistance. Ego depletion is sometimes also referred to as "decision fatigue." The idea behind this concept is that the more decisions we make, the more fatigued we become, and as a result, we are unable to make good decisions. When manipulative people put us in situations where we have to keep making decisions, they eventually are able to wear us out. There are several other factors that have been known to destroy willpower. The first one is scarcity. When something is scarce, we are tempted to act in a more impulsive way to acquire it, abandoning our principles in the process. For instance, when you are hungry, you might be forced to abandon the “thou shalt not steal” principle just to feed yourself. People who are adept at emotional manipulation can chip away at your willpower by introducing the element of scarcity. For example, when a person gives you the silent treatment, she is essentially withholding human interaction and affection, thus making it a scarcity for you. This increases the likelihood that you will abandon your stand and comply with her request. Another way to cancel someone’s willpower is by threatening their wellbeing or their livelihood. Malicious people can compromise your willpower by doing things that jeopardize your job, your relationships, or your happiness. When a colleague does something that puts your job security in jeopardy, or if your partner does something that makes your life a living hell, you will become somewhat desperate, and at that moment, your willpower is more likely to be compromised leading you to either surrender or do something that is detrimental to you. Stress is another factor that can cause the depletion of one's willpower. When we are constantly stressed, our minds are filled with worries that cloud our judgment, and we end up making bad decisions. Malicious people will work both overtly and covertly to introduce stressors into our lives in the hope that the resultant stress will take up all our energy, and we will be left more susceptible to their manipulation. When manipulators succeed in canceling our willpower, then they gain the power to control us and tell us what to do. We will start deferring our judgment to them, and we will lose our identities. Destroy self-esteem Apart from depleting your willpower, malicious people also want to destroy your self-esteem. Unfortunately, there have dozens of different ways that they can do this. In as much as we try to draw our self-esteem from within, the fact remains that as social beings, we put a lot of stock in what other people say about us, and that is where manipulative people draw their strength. Manipulators can chip away at your self-esteem by using carefully worded phrases that are aimed at attacking and belittling you. Their words are usually carefully calculated to either upset you or to confuse you so that you spend a lot of time thinking about what they mean. We have already looked at the kinds of manipulative techniques that can cause you to start questioning yourself or thinking that your own emotions aren’t valid. Manipulators also chip away at your self-esteem by constantly blaming you for all sorts of problems. When someone keeps telling you that certain things are your fault, a seed of self-doubt will start growing in you, and as this idea is reinforced, you will get to a point where you start actually internalizing the person’s criticism, and this ruins your self-esteem. Sometimes, manipulative people can pass the blame onto you without even saying a word. When something bad happens, they’ll give you a look that says everything you need to know about how they feel, and even in the absence of an accusation, you will start questioning yourself. Another way manipulative people destroy your self-esteem is by flooding you with negative information. We all know that self-esteem can be affected by the company we keep. If we surround ourselves with negative people, and they keep saying bad things, we start internalizing those things. Manipulative people, especially Machiavellians, can dupe us by feeding us negative information. For example, a colleague at work could keep pouring cold water on all your ideas until you get to a point where you start believing that you can’t get things done. In relationships, manipulators can destroy your self-esteem by neglecting you emotionally, until you start thinking that you don’t deserve love and affection. Manipulative people can also destroy your self-esteem by feeding your fears. Once they discover that you have certain fears, they’ll start nurturing those fears in you so that they can use them against you. The more afraid we are, the more our self-esteem diminishes. Manipulative people like it when their victims have low self-esteem for a lot of reasons. You have probably heard the saying that if you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything. That is what manipulators are counting on here. They know that if you don't have a strong view of yourself, they can gain the power to control how you view yourself. If you start doubting who you are, they'll take over and create a version of you that they can push around. Manipulators also know that when we have low self-esteem, we become very agreeable because we want to please other people so as to gain some positive attention and to win the approval of others. They want their victims to turn into people-pleasers, and they want to put themselves at the center of the victims’ lives so that they are the ones benefiting from it. At work, manipulators may want to destroy your self-esteem to make you feel like you are not up to the job so that they can climb over you on their way to the top. If they can’t completely convince you that that you are a loser, they’ll settle for making you so afraid of failure that you are even unable to gather the strength to try to compete with them. Manipulators may also want to destroy your self-esteem so that you are unable to maintain your personal boundaries, and they can get in and take advantage of you. Like we have mentioned, when your self-esteem is destroyed, you are unable to stand up for what you believe in, so you can’t enforce your principles. You may feel like you don’t even have the basic right to assert your preferences, so manipulators will be at liberty to walk all over you. Passive-aggressive revenge Some manipulators will go after you because they are seeking passive- aggressive revenge against you. If you have ever slighted a narcissistic person, a sadist, or a psychopath in any way, they are probably holding some sort of grudge against you, and they may manipulate you because they want to get even. Now, normal people hold grudges or go after each other for clear reasons that both parties are aware of. However, people with dark personality traits can target you for pretty much any reason, as long as it makes sense to them. There is no logical threshold that you have to meet for them to set their sights on you. They could hold a grudge for years because of a statement that you made in passing. They could make you their target because your boss complimented you instead of them. They could even target you because of deep psychological issues that even they cannot comprehend. For instance, a psychopath may seek to victimize you and destroy your life because you look like the girl who rejected him way back when he was a teenager. The point is you don’t have to do anything specific for a malicious person to decide to seek passive-aggressive revenge against you. It’s possible that you just have the misfortune of reminding them of a mean parent they had growing up, or in the case of Machiavellians, it could just be that you are on their way and they have to destroy you to get ahead. It could also be that they think you are weak, and therefore, you are an easy target for them. When someone is seeking passive-aggressive revenge against you, they'll want to put you down so that they can feel superior. They think that you have it good, so they want to cut you down to size by making you feel insecure. If you outperform them at work, they'll want your performance to decline because it will make them feel better. Such people will treat you with a lot of disguised verbal hostility. They will propagate negative gossip about you when you are away. They will go out of their way to find fault in the things that you do, and they will be habitually critical of you. They’ll try their best to invalidate your thoughts, feeling, and contributions because they just don't want you to be happy. Some people will seek passive-aggressive revenge against you because they are miserable, and misery loves company. Most people with dark personality traits just can’t stand seeing you happy when they are miserable. The narcissists believe the world revolves around them, so if they are miserable, they’ll expect everyone else to be miserable, and they’ll try to punish anyone who isn’t miserable through psychological manipulation. Sadists will try to make you miserable as a way of cheering themselves up. Machiavellians, on the other hand, will scheme to steal your happiness. People seeking passive-aggressive revenge often use disguised hostile humor to bring others down. They use sarcasm to veil their hostility towards others. They'll say hurtful things then claim that they are "just kidding." They'll attack others based on their looks, their social-cultural background, their gender and sexual orientation, their levels of education, and anything else that comes to mind. In other words, these manipulators have deep-seated issues which result in psychological disturbances, and they'll go out of their way to harm others in order to satisfy their psychological needs. Confuse reality Manipulators also want to confuse your reality so that they can control you. Altering a person’s perception of reality is the ultimate way to control and dominate them. That’s because when you can convince a person that what he sees and hears isn't real, then you gain the power to tell them what they should think, what you should feel, and what you should value. Controlling other people's reality is the ultimate dream for any manipulator. They want you to substitute your judgment for theirs, and the chances of that happening increase exponentially when you question your own reality. That is why mind control manipulation techniques, such as brainwashing and gaslighting, are the most dangerous ones. There are lots of reasons why a manipulator would want to confuse his victim's reality. An abusive partner would want you to quit looking for help, so they would either want you to believe that you are going crazy and the abuse isn’t really happening, or that no one will offer you the love and protection that you are hoping for, so you should stop searching for it. When psychopath’s gaslight others, they tend to do it intentionally. They are deliberately trying to damage their victim's mental health because they know when you are mentally weak, they can control you. They don't have a conscience, so they don't care if they do irreversible damage. Narcissists, on the other hand, tend to gaslight others or confuse their reality unintentionally. That is because the narcissists are themselves delusional; they have delusions of grandeur, and they think that they are entitled to dominate you. They'll confuse your reality because they want to impose their own perceptions onto you so that their delusions of grandeur can become your reality. Bullies and sadists will want to confuse your reality because they want it to be bleak. Their intention is to make you have a pessimistic outlook, just like them. Chapter 7: Behavioral Traits of Favorite Victims of Manipulators There are certain characteristics and behavioral traits that make people more vulnerable to manipulation, and people with dark psychology traits know this full well. They tend to seek out victims who have those specific behavioral traits because they are essentially easy targets. Let’s discuss 6 of the traits of the favorite victims of manipulators. Emotional insecurity and fragility Manipulators like to target victims who are emotionally insecure or emotionally fragile. Unfortunately for these victims, such traits are very easy to identify even in total strangers, so it’s easy for experienced manipulators to find them. People who are emotionally insecure tend to be very defensive when they are attacked or when they are under pressure, and that makes them easy to spot in social situations. Even after just a few interactions, a manipulator can gauge with a certain degree of accuracy, how insecure a person is. They’ll try to provoke their potential targets in a subtle way, and then wait to see how the targets react. If they are overly defensive, manipulators will take it as a sign of insecurity, and they will intensify their manipulative attacks. Manipulators can also tell if a target is emotionally insecure if he/she redirects accusations or negative comments. They will find a way to put you on the spot, and if you try to throw it back at them, or to make excuses instead of confronting the situation head-on, the manipulator could conclude that you are insecure and therefore an easy target. People who have social anxiety also tend to have emotional insecurity, and manipulators are aware of this fact. In social gatherings, they can easily spot individuals who have social anxiety, then target them for manipulation. "Pickup artists" are able to identify the girls who seem uneasy in social situations by the way they conduct themselves. Social anxiety is difficult to conceal, especially to manipulators who are experienced at preying on emotional vulnerability. Emotional fragility is different from emotional insecurity. Emotionally insecure people tend to show it all the time, while emotionally fragile people appear to be normal, but they break down emotionally at the slightest provocation. Manipulators like targeting emotionally fragile people because it’s very easy to elicit a reaction from them. Once a manipulator finds out that you are emotionally fragile, he is going to jump at the change to manipulate you because he knows it would be fairly easy. Emotional fragility can be temporary, so people with these traits are often targeted by opportunistic manipulators. A person may be emotionally stable most of the time, but he/she may experience emotional fragility when they are going through a breakup, when they are grieving, or when they are dealing with a situation that is emotionally draining. The more diabolical manipulators can earn your trust, bid their time, and wait for you to be emotionally fragile. Alternatively, they can use underhanded methods to induce emotional fragility in a person they are targeting. Sensitive people Highly sensitive people are those individuals who process information at a deeper level and are more aware of the subtleties in social dynamics. They have lots of positive attributes because they tend to be very considerate of others, and they watch their step to avoid causing people any harm, whether directly or indirectly. Such people tend to dislike any form of violence or cruelty, and they are easily upset by news reports about disastrous occurrences, or even depictions of gory scenes in movies. Sensitive people also tend to get emotionally exhausted from taking in other people’s feelings. When they walk into a room, they have the immediate ability to detect other people’s moods, because they are naturally skilled at identifying and interpreting other people’s body language cues, facial expressions, and tonal variations. Manipulators like to target sensitive people because they are easy to manipulate. If you are sensitive to certain things, manipulators can use them against you. They will feign certain emotions to draw sensitive people in so that they can exploit them. Sensitive people also tend to scare easily. They have a heightened "startle reflex," which means that they are more likely to show clear signs of fear or nervousness in potentially threatening situations. For example, sensitive people are more likely to jump up when someone sneaks up on them, even before they determine whether they are in any real danger. If you are a sensitive person, this trait can be very difficult to hide, and malicious people will be able to see it from a mile away. Sensitive people also tend to be withdrawn. They are mostly introverts, and they like to keep to themselves because social stimulation can be emotionally draining for them. Manipulators who are looking to control others are more likely to target people who are introverted because that trait makes it easy to isolate potential victims. Manipulators can also identify sensitive people by listening to how they talk. Sensitive people tend to be very proper; they never use vulgar language, and they tend to be very politically correct because they are trying to avoid offending anyone. They also tend to be polite, and they say please and thank you more often than others. Manipulators go after such people because they know that they are too polite to dismiss them right away; sensitive people will indulge anyone because they don't want to be rude, and that gives maliciously people a way in. Emphatic people Emphatic people are generally similar to highly sensitive people, except that they are more attuned to the feelings of others and the energy of the world around them. They tend to internalize other people's suffering to the point that it becomes their own. In fact, for some of them, it can be difficult to distinguish someone's discomfort from their own. Emphatic people make the best partners because they feel everything you feel. However, this makes them particularly easy to manipulate, which is why malicious people like to target them. Malicious people can feign certain emotions, and convey those emotions to emphatic people, who will feel them as though they were real. That opens them up for exploitation. Emphatic people are the favorite targets of psychopathic conmen because they feel so deeply for others. A conman can make up stories about financial difficulties and swindle lots of money from emphatic people. The problem with being emphatic is that because you have such strong emotions, you easily dismiss your own doubts about people because you would much rather offer help to a person who turns out to be a lair than deny help to a person who turns out to be telling the truth. Emphatic people have a big-hearts, and they tend to be extremely generous, often to their own detriment. They are highly charitable, and they feel guilty when others around them suffer, even if it’s not their fault and they can’t do anything about it. Malicious people have a very easy time taking such people on guilt trips. They are the kind of people who would willingly fork over their life savings to help their friends get out of debt, even if it means they would be ruined financially. Malicious people like to get into relationships with emphatic people because they are easy to take advantage of. Emphatic people try to avoid getting into intimate relationships in the first place because they know that it’s easy for them to get engulfed in such relationships and to lose their identities in the process. However, manipulators will doggedly pursue them because they know that once they get it, they can guilt the emphatic person into doing anything they want. Fear of loneliness Many people are afraid of being alone, but this fear is more heightened in a small percentage of the population. This kind of fear can be truly paralyzing for those who experience it, and it can open them up to exploitation by malicious people. For example, there are many people who stay in dysfunctional relationships because they are afraid, they will never find someone else to love them if they break up with an abusive partner. Manipulators can identify this fear in a victim, and they'll often do everything they can to fuel it further to make sure that the person is crippled by it. People who are afraid of being alone can tolerate or even rationalize any kind of abuse. The fear of being alone can be easy to spot in a potential victim. People with this kind of fear tend to exude some level of desperation at the beginning of relationships, and they can sometimes come across as clingy. While ordinary people may think of being clingy as a red flag, manipulative people will see it as an opportunity to exploit somebody. If you are attached to them, they’ll use manipulative techniques to make you even more dependent on them. They can withhold love and affection (e.g., by using the silent treatment) to make the victim fear that he/she is about to get dumped so that they act out of desperation and cede more control to the manipulator. The fear of being alone is, for the most part, a social construct, and it disproportionately affects women more than men. For generations, our society has taught women that their goal in life is to get married and have children, so, even the more progressive women who reject this social construct are still plagued by social pressures to adhere to those old standards. That being said, the fact is that men also tend to be afraid of being alone. People with abandonment issues stemming from childhood tend to experience the fear of loneliness to a higher degree. There are also those people who may not necessarily fear loneliness in general, but they are afraid of being separated from the important people in their lives. For example, lots of people end up staying in abusive or dysfunctional relationships because they are afraid of being separated from their children. Fear of disappointing others We all feel a certain sense of obligation towards the people in our lives, but there are some people who are extremely afraid of disappointing others. This kind of fear is similar to the fear of embarrassment and the fear of rejection because it means that the person puts a lot of stock into how others perceive him or her. The fear of disappointing others can occur naturally, and it can actually be useful in some situations; parents who are afraid of disappointing their families will work harder to provide for them, and children who are afraid of disappointing their parents will study harder at school. In this case, the fear is actually constructive. However, it becomes unhealthy when it’s directed at the wrong people, or when it forces you to compromise your own comfort and happiness. When manipulators find out that you have a fear of disappointing others, they'll try to put you in a position where you feel like you owe them something. They’ll do certain favors for you, and then they’ll manipulate you into believing that you have a sense of obligation towards them. They will then guilt you into complying with any request whenever they want something from you. Personality Dependent disorders and emotional dependency Dependent personality disorder refers to a real disorder that is characterized by a person having an excessive and even pervasive need to be taken care of. This need often leads the person to be submissive towards the people in their lives and to be clingy and afraid of separation. People with this disorder act in ways that are meant to elicit caregiving. They tend to practice what's called "learned helplessness." This is where they act out of a conviction that they are unable to do certain things for themselves, and they need the help of others. Such people have a hard time making decisions, even when dealing with simple things like picking out which clothes to wear. They need constant reassurance and advice, and they let others take the lead in their own lives. These are the kinds of people who either move back into their parents' homes as adults or treat their spouses and partners as though they are their parents. Manipulators like to target people with dependent personality disorders because they are very easy to control and dominate. These people willingly cede control over their lives to others, so when manipulators come knocking, they don’t face much resistance. Manipulators start off by giving them a false sense of security, but once they have won their trust, they switch gears and start imposing their will on them. Emotional dependency is somewhat similar to dependent personality disorder, but it doesn't rise to the level of clinical significance. It stems from having low self-esteem, and it’s often a result of childhood abandonment issues. People with an emotional dependency will play the submissive role in relationships for fear of losing their partners. They tend to be very agreeable because they want to please the people in their lives. Such people are easy to manipulate, and malicious people can easily dominate them. Chapter 8: The Role of Defense To avoid falling victim to manipulators, you have to build your defenses so that you are prepared for any manipulative strategies that they may try to use on you. The best way to build your defenses is by taking steps to improve your self-esteem and your willpower. However, as a point of caution, you should be very careful about how you build your defenses because you don’t want to create restrictions that will keep you from living a fulfilled life. For example, as you try to guard against manipulation, you can’t act out of fear. You can’t hide from the world just to avoid scenarios where someone might want to take advantage of you. Remember that the world is full of people with dark personality traits who may harbor malicious intentions, so acting out of fear won’t protect you from anyone. In fact, it will just make you more of a target. As you build your defenses, make sure that start on the premise that you are willing to confront manipulators head on, and you will never run away or recoil. If you act out of fear, you lose by default. The steps to raise self-esteem: To help you build your defenses, we will discuss the eight steps that you have to take in order to raise your self-esteem and to increase your willpower by extension. Acceptance Acceptance is about assenting to the reality of a given situation. It’s about recognizing that a certain condition or process is what it is, even if it’s characterized by high levels of discomfort and negativity. It’s about consciously submitting to the fact that something cannot be changed, and that its reality is not subject to interpretation. It’s about making peace with the situation that you are in. Acceptance is the opposite of denial. Even the most rational among us tend to be in denial about lots of things in their lives, which are settled facts in real sense. Denial can be a coping mechanism, one that can keep us from being overwhelmed by the reality of a given situation. However, denial does us more harm than good, because unless we can accept something, we can’t change it, and we will be stuck looking for alternative interpretations and explanations for our prevailing circumstances. Without acceptance, the door remains wide open for malicious people to exploit us. Take the example of a patient who is told that he/she is terminally ill. After seeking the opinions of several medical professionals and getting the same diagnosis, the patient is still left with the choice of either accepting or denying the situation. The one who accepts it will make peace, and try to make the best out of what little time he has. The one who stays in denial will become susceptible to tricksters who may offer "alternative cures," and he may end up losing all his savings paying such people so that in the end, he leaves his family with nothing. That is an extreme example, but it perfectly illustrates why acceptance is important in avoiding manipulation, even if the reality may seem too painful to accept. The most crucial form of acceptance is self-acceptance. It refers to the state of being satisfied with yourself, the way you currently are. Self-acceptance is a kind of covenant that you make with yourself, to validate, support, and appreciate who you are instead of constantly criticizing yourself and wishing you were someone else. Most people have trouble accepting themselves as they are. We are all in a constant strive for self-improvement. We want to be more successful, to be wealthier, to be more attractive, or to be perceived more positively by others. Even the most accomplished among us have issues with self-acceptance. In many ways, the desire to be a better version of yourself can be seen as a positive thing; it can help you study harder in school, work harder to earn a promotion at work or exercise more to get in shape. However, the problem is there is always room for improvement, so no matter how high you ascend, the dissatisfaction will always be there, and it will make you vulnerable to manipulation by people who want to take advantage of your desires. To defend against manipulation, you have to accept your reality, and you have to accept yourself. People tend to think that if they accept themselves, they won’t try to improve - that couldn’t be further from the truth. Accepting yourself means owning up to your flaws, and that gives you control over your life. With self-acceptance, attempts at self-improvement would come from within, so when you decide to change, you will be doing it for yourself and not for anyone else. Increase awareness Increasing your awareness means having a higher level of alertness when it comes to understanding what’s going on in your environment. It means paying close attention to your surroundings, and to the way, people behave around you. The higher your level of awareness, the better you will be when it comes to adapting to your surroundings and understanding the motivations of the people you interact with. When you become more aware, you will be able to catch on quick when people try to manipulate you. Many of us tend to be preoccupied with our own thoughts that we hardly ever notice the cues of the people we interact with. We tend to live life on autopilot, so when other people try to seize control over our lives, we only notice it when it’s too late. If you increase your awareness, you will be equipped with the skills necessary to identify all the red flags, and you will be able to stop most manipulators on their tracks before they can do any real harm. The first step towards increasing your awareness is to learn about the tendencies of manipulative people. Reading this book puts you ahead of the curve; you now know enough to be able to spot people with ill motives, but you should understand that the worst kinds of manipulators are very good at concealing their motives, so you have to keep working on increasing your awareness. To be truly aware of manipulative people, you have to approach all interactions with some levels of skepticism. We are not telling you to turn into a paranoid person who doesn't let anyone in; we are just saying that you should take a deeper look each person you interact with. Try to study their body language and their words, and try to see if they are trying to hide something. Apart from increasing your awareness, you have to increase your self- awareness as well. Many people confuse those two things, but them entirely different concepts. Self-awareness is about understanding yourself. It’s about having a clear concept of your own personality. You have to examine yourself and figure out what your strengths and weaknesses are, what your values and motivations are, and what kind of thoughts and emotions you are likely to have in specific situations. Self-awareness helps you understand both who you are and how other people perceive you. Self-awareness works as a defense against manipulation because when you know who you truly are, it becomes more difficult for someone to alter your thoughts and perceptions. If you have strong and well-articulated values, it becomes harder for a manipulator to get you to abandon those values. People who like self-awareness are more likely to be gaslighted or to be subjected to other forms of mind control. If you end up in a relationship with a manipulative person, self-awareness can help you keep your identity. Manipulators will try to tell you what to think and how to behave, but if you are self-aware, you will experience cognitive dissonance, and your brain will push back against any attempts at manipulation. Detach with love Detaching with love is a defense against manipulation that is most commonly used by people who have loved ones who suffer from substance abuse problems. Even though it was conceptualized to help people deal with addicts, it can also work when you are dealing with manipulators. Detaching with love is about showing love and compassion for others without taking responsibility for their actions. For example, if you have a family member who is a drug addict, the way it works is that you try to support them and encourage them to get clean, but you let them make their own decisions, and you let them suffer the consequences of their actions. If the addict doesn’t come home, you don’t waste your time looking for them in the seedy parts of the city, you stay at home, and you do the things that benefit you and make you happy. The point of detaching with love is to stop trying to control other people's lives, even if you are doing it for their own good. The idea is that you accept that people are different from you and that they have their own free will. Detaching from love can defend you from manipulation in many ways. There are manipulators who want to exploit you by making you responsible for them. We have mentioned several times in the book that some malicious people will take the submissive position in a relationship because they want your world to revolve around them. They want you to give them all your attention; that is how they control you. When you detach with love, you will learn to stop fixing everyone’s problems. So, when the manipulator tries to play the victim in order to gain your sympathy, you will keep doing whatever is in your best interest, and you will tell him or her to take responsibility for his or her own actions. Some manipulators may take up self-destructive habits because they want to dominate you by making you clean up after them. When they do this, you can detach with love by letting them follow the paths they have taken, no matter where they lead them. If they are causing you harm, you can get away from them, but leave your door open. If they find the right path in the future and regain control over their own lives, you can let them in again. You have to make it very clear, through your words and actions that you will let them direct their own lives, and you won’t take any responsibility for them. Detaching with love is about accepting others for who they are, and respecting them enough to let them be in charge of changing their own lives. When you feel responsible for someone, and he makes a choice that harms you both, often times, you will react with fear, anger, or anxiety. To detach with love, you have to learn to let go of those negative emotions. Manipulators count on the fact that you will react in a predictable way to their machinations, but when you detach with love, you learn to calm yourself down and think about your role in the other person's life before you take any sort of action. This will keep you from falling into the traps that manipulators will set for you. Detaching with love builds your self-esteem because it allows you to put your own needs ahead of those of the people that try to manipulate you. Build self-esteem You can defend against manipulation by building your self-esteem in the old school way; using self-help techniques. People tend to discount classic self- help techniques, but they actually work. They won’t solve all your problems, but they'll make you feel worthy enough and give you the strength to resist many forms of manipulation. The oldest self-help technique in the book is to try to be nicer to yourself. This usually involves being kind to yourself and being your own cheerleader. It also involved challenging the negative thought and assumptions that you make every day. It also involved treating yourself as you would treat a close friend. If your friend had certain fears and doubts and he came to you for advice, you would try to tell him the truth, but you won’t be harsh with him. Similarly, you should embrace your reality even if it’s uncomfortable, but you shouldn’t beat yourself up even if you have made mistakes. Even when things are gloomy, you should try to talk yourself up. We all have to draw strength from somewhere. That means that if you don’t try to build your own self-esteem, you will look for external sources of strength and motivation, but the problem with that is that people have their own interests and agendas, and your wellbeing isn’t always their biggest priority. When you look for strength from external sources, you open yourself up for manipulation. You can also build your self-esteem by avoiding comparing yourself with other people. Manipulators are very good at preying on your desires. When you desire the things that other people have, manipulators see this as an opportunity to gain control over you. Most people who end up getting conned are usually pulled in because they are blinded by their desires, and they want what other people have. To build your self-esteem, you have to do your own thing. You should pursue your own interests and create your own goals. Never live your life by measuring it against someone else’s. That is a surefire way of obliterating your self-esteem, introducing negative emotions into your life, and opening the door for all sorts of predatory characters. You can also build your self-esteem by being careful about the kind of company you keep. Surround yourself with positive people who make you happy, and try to keep away from the kind of people who are constantly negative, or those who unnerves you. You can also build your self-esteem by exercising more. Studies show that when we exercise, we are more motivated, more confident, and we feel more in control of our lives. Working out makes our bodies release feel-good hormones, which can help boost our self-esteem. Change reactions To defend against manipulation, there is one important thing that you need to realize; the only person you can control is you. You have absolutely no control over what other people might say, or how they might act. Your reaction is the only thing that is within your control. Even if you are a victim, and someone limits your choices considerably, at the end of the day, the power to choose how to act or react is still in your control. Think of all the civil rights icons you learned about in school; all of these people were victimized in one way or another, but they came out on top because of the way they chose to react to that victimization. So, to defend against manipulation, you have to change the way you react to the words and actions of manipulators. First, when someone does something to set you off, try to approach that situation with calm rationality. Focus on resolving the conflict instead of debating whose fault it is. When you react with anger in response to an accusation, or if you start passing the blame back and forth, you are playing right into the hand of the manipulator. When you change the way you react, you will be creating your own rules for the game that the manipulator is trying to play, and that will keep you from falling into his trap. Never lead with your emotions. Instead, you should practice thinking things through before you react. In other words, instead of reacting instantaneously, train yourself to respond in a calculated way. When someone upsets you, refrain from lashing out angrily, and try to figure out what their motivations are. You can manage your reactions by using the same techniques that are used in anger management therapy; take a deep breath and weight the situation before speaking out. It may not seem so, but the simple act of taking a deep breath can do a lot to center you and to help you react better in any stressful situation. When you take a breath, it puts some distance between your reaction and the trigger situation, and that small window of time is enough for your brain to deliberate on things and to create a better response. You also have to understand that things only have the meanings you give them. When a manipulator calls you names or yells at you angrily, it’s completely up to you to decide whether you’ll let it roll off you like water, or whether you will internalize it. It’s true that people only treat you the way you let them. You can change your reaction by changing the questions that run through your mind when you are in a negative situation. If someone is attacking you, the questions running through your mind could be: Why is he doing this? Who does he think he is? You can try to change those questions so that you start thinking: How can I quickly resolve this? How can I keep my dignity here? When you ask yourself the right questions, you have a better chance of finding a proper way to react. Be assertive Someone can only successfully manipulate you if you are not willing to stand your ground and be assertive. Some psychologists have pointed out that being assertive is the middle ground between being passive and being aggressive. Aggressive people bully others to get what they want, and passive people let others walk all over them, so they don't get what they want. Assertive people, on the other hand, stand strong and ask for what they want in a firm and diplomatic way. When you are assertive, you communicate in a way that's respectful towards the needs, feelings, and opinions of others, but you are unwavering in advocating for your own needs. You make requests that are reasonable, and you try to avoid infringing on the rights of others. In case of a dispute, you seek a compromise that is objectively fair to everyone. You draw clear boundaries, and you let people know when they are crossing those boundaries. The most crucial aspect of assertiveness is being a good communicator. Assertive people have voices that are relaxed but firm. They speak fluently, and they come across as sincere. When they have to work with others, they are cooperative, and they contribute in a constructive way. They don't raise their voices when things get heated; they stay steady, unshaken, and unfailingly logical. Assertive people are also good at using non-verbal cues to communicate effectively. They maintain eye contact with the people they are talking too. They have open body stances and good posture, which helps project strength and confidence. They smile when they are pleased, and they frown when they are displeased. Assertive people are very direct, and they know what they want from the very beginning. As a result, it’s very difficult for you to manipulate them. Manipulators like to use mind games and other little tricks to conceal their ill intentions, but assertive people will cut through all that by enforcing straight and clear two-way communication. When ordinary people suspect that they are being manipulated, they may keep those suspicions to themselves, but assertive people will come out and ask the manipulators what their intentions are; this throws the manipulators off balance and forces them to back off or switch gears. Being assertive means having the skills to communicate with both aggressive people and passive people. They don't let anger or fear keep them from putting their point across when they are dealing with aggressive people. However, when they are dealing with passive people, they also don't let other people's meekness, deter them from demanding what they are entitled to. Assertive people are also well attuned with their own emotions. When they are upset, they don’t let their own negative feelings derail them from asserting for themselves in a rational manner. Feed yourself The idea that the food we eat affects our self-esteem has been around for a very long time. There is a lot of scientific evidence that shows a correlation between the type of food we eat and our levels of confidence, as well as our general mental wellbeing. The food you eat has an effect on your mood, your levels of anxiety, and how you feel about yourself as a person. When we lack the right balance of nutrients in our bodies, it affects the levels of certain hormones, and as a result, we experience a shift in our moods. That explains why we tend to be more active and stimulated when we consume sugar, coffee, or foods with high levels of carbohydrates. There are also other foods that make us feel lethargic when we eat them. Some researchers have found out that when we fail to take in enough vitamins, fatty acid, and certain mineral, and omega three oils, we could experience depression. Because of their ability to keep depression at bay, these foods are referred to as "mood-boosting foods." Carbohydrates are usually broken into glucose, which is used as energy in the brain and in the muscles. If we don't eat enough carbohydrates, we will lack the energy to concentrate and to make good judgments, and that can affect our self-esteem and make us more susceptible to manipulation. On the flip side, eating lots of carbohydrates lead us to gain weight, and that can have a negative effect on our self-esteem. So, if positive self-esteem is your goal, you need to eat the right amount of carbohydrate; don't kick them off your diet, but also don't overindulge in them. Try to eat carbohydrate from whole- food sources instead of refined sources. Unrefined carbohydrates release energy slowly and give you a mood boost for much longer while providing you with much-needed fiber. Foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids prevent low moods and can help keep you from getting depressed. Based on that, some scientists have argued that eating more fish can help improve your self-esteem. As you plan out your diet, you can make sure that you have at least one portion of fish a week. As a point of caution, avoid eating too much fish if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Foods that are rich in vitamin B, such as spinach, broccoli, meats, eggs, and dairy, have the ability to boost your energy levels and your mood, so they can contribute towards you having a more positive outlook. Vitamin D food sources such as eggs, cereals, and oily fish can increase serotonin levels in your brain and make you feel good about yourself. Of course, you can also get vitamin D from the sun, so letting in the light or talking a walk outside every now and then can be good for your self-esteem as well. Excessive sugar, too much caffeine, and a high amount of alcohol can affect your self-esteem in a negative way. When you have a sugary snack, it increases your blood sugar levels and causes a spike in energy, but that is just momentary. After that, you will experience a "crush." That, combined with the feeling of guilt that comes from consuming "empty calories" can dampen your mood and lower your self-esteem. Caffeine also has a similar effect. It will stimulate you, for a moment and improve your mood, but once it starts wearing off, your mood will go down. Alcohol has the effect of improving your confidence and lowering your inhibitions, which is why it’s referred to as a "social lubricant." However, it is also a depressant, which means that it will make you feel anxious and irritable the following day, and that is bad for your self-esteem. By lowering your inhibitions, alcohol can also make you more susceptible to manipulation. Become autonomous and take control To increase your self-esteem and to become less susceptible to manipulation, you have to become autonomous and to take control of your own life. Researchers have found that autonomy is more highly correlated with happiness than any other factor out there. People who are autonomous tend to be more satisfied than those who are wealthy. That is because autonomy represents the core value that makes us human; the ability to exercise free will. In many social sciences, autonomy is defined as the quality of being able to make decisions according to one’s own free will. Since we are social beings, it can be argued that we don’t have absolute free will because the things we do are constrained by the rules of the societies we live in, but the important thing is that autonomy should be characterized by a feeling of freedom. In other words, it’s about being able to do things within being coerced by either internal or external pressures. To put it simply, autonomy is having your own identity, and being the only one that controls it. It’s very easy to lose your autonomy when you are in a relationship with a controlling person. Even if you are part of a couple or a family, autonomy means that you do things because you want to and not because you are obligated to do them. It means that there should be a clear distinction between you and your partner and that everyone should have their goals and ambitions, independent of each other. If you are in a relationship where you are subservient to the other person, then you lack autonomy. To maintain your autonomy and improve your self-esteem, be very careful about who you choose to date, and the people you choose to associate with. Even if you are committed to the person, you have to know at all times what your values are, what you want out of life, and who you are as a person. You need to hold onto those foundational values, and you should be wary of anyone who tries to make you compromise on them. You have to retain control over your life, no matter how much it’s intertwined with someone else’s. If you can’t define yourself, someone else is going to do it for you, and then you will become a mere extension of them. In other words, they will succeed in completely dominating and controlling you. You can take control of your life by setting aside some “me time” for yourself. It’s okay to take care of your family, friends, or partner, but if you let them have all your time, then you lose control over your life, and your identity will disappear. Set some time aside for yourself, and make sure that everyone respects it. You also need to draw clear personal boundaries and to learn to say "no" to people. When someone asks you to do something, make an objective assessment of the request; if it adds no value to your life, then turn it down. Manipulative people will want to turn you into their "errand boy," so from the very first time you meet anyone, make sure that you don't let them use you.

Persuasion and Dark Psychology: How to Detect Deception in Psychology of Persuasion, Read Body Language, Dark NLP, Hypnosis and Defend Yourself from Covert Emotional Manipulation and Dark Psychology INTRODUCTION What does psychology mean? The excellent minds that have existed before us, psychology as the science of the soul can be defined as having its start and its end with the mind. It is not just science, however, because it contains elements that can be aware or unconscious. It also involves patterns of behaviour. Many have discovered the minds of the human being to be very puzzling and intriguing and, therefore, they have taken a career in the areas of psychology, scientific science as well as philosophy, in order to debunk this enigma that is the human mind. They are listening and helping us navigate through problems like depression or anxiety. The darkness in us is suppressed with their assistance, and we can live our life. In neuropsychology, a branch of psychology which deals with the way the brain is related to conduct and feelings focused on knowing the human mind. How does the brain collect data? How is this data processed? How do you lastly store that data? These issues relate to neuropsychology. Understanding how the mind functions go beyond visiting a shrink, who provides guidance and some pills or the fundamental knowledge of the brain. It is much deeper. It is much deeper. In us all, it is nice and bad. According to Colin McGinn, evil people generally get enjoyment from pain and vice versa. We people have all these emotions, fear, happiness, joy, pain, sadness and sometimes, in the process, we can harm others if we cannot regulate our feelings. Now, what is psychology of darkness? Dark psychology is the research we use to hurt others around us intentionally and intentionally. Dark psychology is about mind control and manipulation. It is said that we all have that' darkness within' as human beings. Man is also said to have intrinsic evil or sin from Christian scriptures. Sometimes, the darkness in us makes us do something unexpected. Take a person's example, you knew they were good, then they suddenly do the unexpected one day and then we do not want to associate with them anymore. Dark psychology is about control and manipulation of the mind. This art of manipulation and somehow influencing people to do your job begins with a kid shouting at an early age so that parents can come to their rescue. Every time the child wants something, it is repeated. Parents sometimes see that as harmless, that is, no parent wants to see their baby cry. Parents who do not prevent this conduct ensure that this manipulation remains later in the lives of the child. It's about dark psychology. Get into a person's mind and understand his or her behavioural patterns. Having clarified this otherwise wide topic, let us now try to familiarize ourselves with the multiple impacts of dark psychology. Both the victim and the perpetrator feel the impacts of dark psychology. In order to understand the effects, we need to investigate certain aspects of dark psychology. People with certain personality features, which are seen as obscure, such as narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, are likely to have problems in all aspects of their relations. They are more likely to commit a crime if all three characteristics are present in one individual. The three personality traits mentioned above have particular features. For instance, a sense of rightfulness, feelings of superiority, profound envy for the achievement of others and exploitative behaviour. Psychopathy has a lack of guilt, a lack of empathy, a destructive impulsive behaviour, self- cantering and a lack of accountability. Machiavellian features are indicators of egoism, ruthlessness, and manipulation. These features are problem- specific individually but can be combined to cause problems with spelling. In the connection between an individual and others in particular. People who enter into contact with them pay a heavy emotional price if you have encountered an individual who is defined by these experiences; leave them for the sake of your health and well-being. If you experience that, on the other hand, you are looking for the psychical assistance you need to improve. No matter how deeply rooted these problems are, you can improve your behaviour and experience by using the right form of therapy. The first step is to understand what the scenario is, acknowledge that you have an issue and seek assistance quickly. It makes us all emotionally and mentally drained to cope with individuals who have the characteristics I listed above. The impact can sometimes be physical and in extreme instances deadly. The nice neighbour whose terrible experience caused me to write this book lost everything on this trip physically. His home, his company, his finances, but his loss was much deeper and bigger. We had no connection with the perpetrator, but we were victims, too. Our losses were not as monumental as yours, but we also suffered losses. We lost our nice neighbour in the beginning. She didn't die, but she never recovered from the experience. We lost our capacity to trust strangers. Even our relationships seemed to require a further level of trust to flourish. The greatest effect of dark psychology on anybody is that it generates a powerful feeling of loss. We are losing our precious things, we lose relationships, we lose ourselves [I will clarify that in a little] and for those who are highly dissatisfied we lose their life. Taking all stuff into account, it is secure to say that the effect of this darkness is profound. When an individual display one of the dark personality traits, specialists say, the individual has a very elevated tendency to display the others. Generally, if bigger members of society have such features, it is secure to say that the rate of crime in this community will be considerably high. CHAPTER ONE: WHAT IS PERSUASION Persuasion is a theme of dark psychology that can be said to share quite a bit of similarity to manipulation. This is because they are both deployed in order to influence the motivations, behaviours, attitudes, and beliefs of a particular victim. There are a number of reasons why we adopt persuasion into our everyday lives, but the main one would have to be to get people with different ideas on the same page. In company, for instance, the persuasion method will be used to alter the attitude of a person towards an item, concept, or a particular event that is taking place. Either written or spoken phrases will be used during the process to express the other person's thinking, emotions, or data. Another common instance you can use persuasion is to fulfil a private benefit. This would include either advocacy for trial when providing a pitch for sales or during an election campaign. Although none of these are deemed to be good or evil, they are still used to affect the listener to behave or believe in some manner. One understanding of persuasion is that it utilizes one's private or positional resources to alter other people's attitudes or behaviours. There are also several distinct kinds of persuasion recognized; the process of altering views or attitudes by appealing to reason and logic is known as systematic persuasion; the process of altering views and attitudes by appealing to feelings or practices is known as heuristic persuasion. Persuasion is a type of mind control that is constantly being used in society. You may attempt to convince them to believe the same way you do when you speak to someone about politics. You are persuaded to vote a certain way when you listen to a political campaign. There's a lot of persuasion going on when someone is attempting to sell you a fresh item. This form of mind control is so prevalent that most people don't even know it's happening at all to them. The problem will arise when someone takes the time to convince you to believe ideals and values that do not suit your own value system. There are many distinct types of persuasion available. Not all of them have a bad intention, but they will all work to get the subject to change their minds about something. When a political candidate arrives on television, on Election Day they try to get the topic, or the voter, to vote on the ballot a certain way. The company that submitted that advertisement is attempting to get the victim to buy that item when you see a commercial on television or online. All of these are kinds of persuasion that are bent on attempting to modify the way they believe about the victim. To get the victim to modify their way of thinking. Dark persuasion has no moral motivation whatsoever. The motivation is rather amoral and sometimes largely immoral. If beneficial conviction is understandable as assisting individuals to help themselves, dark persuasion can be seen as a mechanism by which individuals behave against their own self-interest. Sometimes people make it reluctantly, knowing that they may not make the best choice, but are keen to stop the continuous persuasion efforts. On other occasions, the best dark persuaders can make someone think they act wisely when they actually do just the opposite. So, what are the primary reasons for these dark persuaders? It depends on the type of person who persuades. Some people try to convince others to serve their own interests. Others do pure harm by the sole malicious intent. They may not profit from persuading anyone, but they do it anyhow, solely in order to bring pain to their victims. Others just appreciate the feeling of control provided by dark persuasion. The result of dark persuasion is also different from positive persuasion. Positive persuasion usually results in one of three scenarios: benefit of the persuaded, benefit for the persuader and the persuaded or mutual benefit for the persuaded individual and a third party. All these results have a positive result for the person to be convinced. Sometimes other people benefit, sometimes they don't. However, there is no situation where only the manipulator benefits. Dark persuasion has a very distinct set of results. The persuader always advantages either immediately or by his distorted need for control and impact. The persuaded individual is against their own self-interest and is not persuaded. Finally, not only do the most qualified dark persuaders' damage their victims, but they also damage others. Take a dark persuader who tells somebody to commit suicide so they can take advantage of an insurance policy. The persuader not only won financially, but also the victim lost his life and hurt everyone who knew or cared for them. Who are these individuals who often tend to use dark persuasion? The main characteristic of a dark persuader is either indifference or an inability to be concerned about the impact of persuasion on others. They are either completely narcissistic and regard their own requirements to be far more essential than the requirements of others or they are sociopathic and unable to even understand the notion of the feelings of others. In a partnership, you often discover dark persuasion. In the worst case scenario, both partners are inclined to persuade the other darkly. The connection can be regarded psychologically abusive if such efforts are persistent and durable. Some instances of dark relationships include not allowing the other partner to take fresh jobs or to take private pleasure. The obscure persuader will persuade the victim to act "for the sake of friendship." The victim merely hurts himself and the relationship in fact. The connection is being damaged as the dark persuader gains greater assurance that his victims can be manipulated. Elements of persuasion Like other types of control, some components are to be observed when it comes to persuasion. These components assist to precisely identify which persuasion makes it clearer. Perloff defined persuasion as a symbolic process in which communications try to convince other people to change their attitudes or behaviours regarding an issue through the transmission of a message in an atmosphere of free choice. This is one salient feature that distinguishes persuasion from all other themes of dark psychology since the victim is in most cases allowed to make choices out of their own will, I as much as persuasion tactics will later work towards changing his will to that of the persuader. The topic can choose the manner they want to believe, whether or not they want to buy a product, or whether they believe the proof behind the persuasion is powerful enough to alter their minds. There are a few components in persuasion that assist to further describe what is while giving us a deeper understanding of this enigmatic theme. The first element of this theme is that persuasion is often symbolic. What this means is that persuasion utilizes words, sound as well as images so as to get the message across to the specific victim. The logic behind this is quite simple really. For one individual to be able to persuade another into acting in a particular way, they will need to show them why they should act in said way and not vice versa. This is best achieved by using word sounds or various images you can use sentences to start a debate or argument to prove your point. Pictures are a great way to show the evidence needed to persuade someone to go one way or the other. Some nonverbal signs are possible, but they are not as effective as using words and images The second key is that persuasion will be used deliberately to affect how others act or think. This one is quite obvious; you don't use persuasion to get them to change if you don't deliberately try to affect others. In order to get the topic to believe the same way they do, the persuader will attempt distinct strategies. This could be as easy as having a discussion with them or presenting proof supporting their point of perspective. On the other hand, to change the mind of the subject, it could involve much more and include more deceptive forms. More will be discussed later in this section on the methods used in persuasion. The distinctive thing about persuasion is that it enables some type of free will for the topic. In this way, the topic is permitted to create its own decision. For the most part, they don't have to go for it, no matter how hard somebody tries to persuade them of something. The subject might hear about the best car to buy a thousand commercials, but if they don't like that brand or don't need a new vehicle at that time, they won't go out and buy it. If the subject is against abortion, how many people will come out and say how great abortion is, it's not likely that the subject will change their minds This enables much more freedom of choice than is found in the other types of mind control, which could explain why when questioned, many individuals do not see this as a kind of mind control. Persuasion is a type of mind control that can take place in many respects. While brainwashing, hypnosis and manipulation must happen face-to-face, and in some instances in full isolation, persuasion may happen otherwise. Examples of persuasion can be found everywhere, including when you talk to individuals you know, on the Internet, on radio and television. It is also feasible to deliver persuasive messages by nonverbal and verbal means; although when verbal methods are used it is much more efficient Subliminal persuasion The word "subliminal" means underneath our consciousness. Subliminal persuasion means an advertising message that is displayed below the threshold of awareness or consumer awareness in order to persuade, persuade or help people change their minds without making them aware of what is going on. This is about affecting individuals with more than words. Some of the subliminal methods of persuasion impact our stimuli with smell, eyesight, sound, touch, and taste. There are mainly 3 subliminal methods of persuasion to affect anyone. They are Building a relationship-building relationship makes the other person feel comfortable. This will open up the other individual more. This can be accomplished through a healthy observation strength that matches their mood or state. This helps create confidence Power of discussion-the power of a powerful convincing person is much connected to an advertiser's conversion. The correct words and inflections help you to be openly straightforward. Suggestive power-Associating useful and desirable stuff in discussion or interaction enables an individual to become more open to fresh thoughts. Suggestion and emotional intelligence This stage may be described as having one central and dominant idea focused on the participant's conscious mind, which was to stimulate or decrease the physiological performance of the various regions within the participant's body. Later on, the use of different non-verbal and verbal suggestions was increasingly emphasized in order to convince the participant easily. CHAPTER TWO: METHODS OF PERSUASION Since by now we have a firm grasp of what persuasion is, let us now dive in headfirst on the various methods of persuasion that are available to us. These persuasion methods can often be classified using other names as well as being referred to in such ways as strategies of persuasion as well as their tactics.it is important to note that there is not only one single method that may be used in order to persuade someone to think and act in the desired way. The manipulator is usually able to talk his victim in a way that they present a certain type of evidence that is generally geared towards switching the subject's mind, they may be able to use some sort of force or pull they have against the victim. This puts the victim in a position where they can perform some services for the victim or use another tactic. Examples of these tactics will be discussed in the concurrent pages of this chapter. Manipulators often take their time in befriending their victims and make sure they admire them to the point of earning the victim's trust and confidence in them.is is after this solid trust base has been established that the persuader starts taking a jab at manipulating their victims. The dark manipulator will start off with some mild insincere positive percussion leading the victim into performing acts that are actually for their own benefits. This is done with three main objectives at heart. The first is to allow the victim to become accustomed to being persuaded by the persuader. This, in turn, makes it possible for the victim to closely associate the positive outcome of a particular persuasion. Once the two are fulfilled, then the persuader can easily persuade the victim to do something against their own self-interest without throwing them off.to get a clear image of this, let’s take the example of a divorced woman. She is in need of love and attention which was denied to her by her ex-husband. She is then befriended by her old college classmate who showers her with intense love and supports making her drop her guard after a few short months. He then takes on advisory roles like offering the best financial choices to make, which fulfils the criteria of small personal persuasions making her trust him even more. He will then go further to manipulate her so as to allow him to invest her money for her, but will instead steal the money leaving his victim in a financial runt shamelessly blaming it on her. Usage of force The first method we shall talk about is the usage of force. The manipulator may decide to use some degree of force in order to successfully persuade the victim into thinking in some specific type of way. This is, however, dependant on the situation at that particular moment. This is however seen to be deployed in instances where, both the ideas of the manipulator and the victim do not seem to match up, the type of conversation they are having don’t seem to bear fruit or where the subject seems to be irritated or frustrated with the turn the conversation has taken. This may be classified as a scare tactic by most since it gives the victim minimal time to think in a logical manner of the events that seem to be transpiring as opposed to when the victim is of a normal state of mind. A manipulator is normally inclined to use force as a method of persuasion is usually when at that particular, they may have hit a wall on their journey of persuasion. They may also result in this if the manipulator feels as though he is losing control of the grasp he had on the victim, or when the victim presents them with solid evidence of the manipulator contradicting them. An experienced manipulator is knowledgeable of the fact that this is not really the best tactic to use when they want to persuade a victim to something. The reason for this is because victims will be able to detect the use of force since they will feel cornered by the mode of conversation they might be having at that moment. The main allure of using force is cantered on the notion of the victim being able to choose their own path.it is then after the deployment of force that the option of having a choice is taken away. Once the victim feels threatened by this, they will most likely listen closely to what the manipulative individual is saying so as to point out the red flags in his speech.it is because of this very reason that using of force is to be used as a last resort of persuasion. Asking leading questions Another method that a dark manipulator skilfully uses is to ask leading questions. It could readily be considered one of the strongest verbal techniques because they ask the victims questions in order to obtain a specific set of responses. For example, a dark persuader may ask their target "how bad you think these people are." This issue already means that the individuals at issue are certainly bad to a certain extent. Dark persuaders ask such skilfully these leading questions, that they instantly feel the victim is whipped up to, leave the vessel and only go back to the questioning line when the victim appears to be in a relaxed position. Dark manipulators also use their real intentions to mask dark persuasion. To be easily exposed to dark persuasion, the dark manipulator hides from the outset his true intention otherwise he will fail. Skilled persuaders may mask their real intentions in a number of ways, depending on the individual victim and circumstance. Dark manipulators have a gift for individuals reading. This implies that once you recognize certain kinds of personality in individuals and then reverse psychology becomes simple to get what you want. Think of a situation with two buddies. One friend tries to win a girl's owner in the classroom while the other friend is the persuader. The persuader understands how badly his friend deals with the women. He chooses to take the unsuspecting woman into the arms of a third person knowing that he is a nice man. Another way of masking dark manipulators is by understanding that it is hard for many to decline two demands in a row. For instance, if a manipulator wishes to obtain a friend's credit form and does not want to return it then he first comes to the victim to think about how he is in a monetary slump, with an exorbitant sum in mind. If the victim expresses his failure to dispense the money, the manipulator then sets the figure well below the initial value, making it difficult for the victim to say "no." Weapons of influence Another method of persuasion that can be used is by using the weapons of influence that are available. There are six main weapons of influence that have been developed and passed on by one individual by the name Robert Cialdini. We shall discuss them in great depth below. Scarcity This is a weapon of influence that many people tend to be a bit familiar with but is often underestimated due to the basic definition of scarcity. If for one reason or another a particular idea or product has a limited time for which is available, it is most likely that a higher price will be attached to it.as human beings we are usually obsessed with chasing after that which we cannot get. When this issue of scarcity surfaces, it will play out depending on the context it is used under. What this means is that it may prove to be advantageous in certain scenarios more than in others. There are two main reasons why this tactic is likely to be successful. The first one is when products are usually a bit too hard to find. These goods will likely have a higher value attached to them. People attribute the high price to the fact that they are rare to find. The second reason is usually when something is not available as it normally has been. This makes the victim begin to have the feeling that they will miss out on the chance of a lifetime. Once both of these have happened, the victim will begin to assign the service that is scarce a higher value simply since it is going to become a bit hard to acquire. Liking This weapon will entail the manipulative individual who will be motivated to work hard in making the victim like them. The reason for this is because once the victim likes this manipulative individual, there is usually more likely to say yes to them if ever they make any request. There are mainly two main factors that will contribute to how well the victim will like the manipulator. Reciprocity This weapon is used in such a way that the victim will try to repay the manipulator in kind when the manipulator provides the victim, with something of value. This basically means that when the manipulator performs some kind of service to the victim, they will tend to feel that at some point they have an obligation to perform a service similar. While the two services may not be the same, they have the same value to match each other's obligations. The act of reciprocation ends up giving the subject a sense of obligation, which the manipulator can then use as a powerful tool when they want to use persuasion. The reciprocity rule is very effective as it helps the manipulator get the victim into the right frame of mind for the act of persuasion by instilling and overpowering the victim with a sense of duty. The manipulator may be more likely to convince the victim to do or act in some way because at this point will have that sense of duty hanging over them. Commitment and consistency This is where the manipulative individual will have to use both of these tools if they want any person to change their point of view of any particular thing. They are easier to understand when things are consistent and can help the subject make better decisions. It’s not good for the manipulator to always change the facts they use or change other information needed to help the victim process the information. Instead of helping with the persuasion process, keeping away constantly from consistency will make the agent look like a liar and someone who cannot be trusted, resulting in the persuasion process failure. Consistency is a great tool since it usually allows the victim to make the right decisions and process information. If the manipulator wants to succeed in persuading the victim, they need to make sure their message is consistent. There is no room for false evidence that may later appear and ruin the entire process. Keep the facts accurate and concise, and to persuade the victim is much better. Social proof Persuasion is a form of social interaction and therefore the social rules where it occurs will have to be followed. The victim will be influenced by the people around them; they will be more likely to want to do what others are doing instead of doing their own thing. The victim will base their beliefs and actions on what others do about them, how they act and how they believe the saying "the crowd's power" can be very effective under this belief. The victim will want to know at all times what other people around them are doing. In this country, being able to do what others are doing to fit in, despite the fact that people will say how they want to be different and be an individual, has become almost an obsession. Authority One way the manipulator will succeed in persuading the victim is by becoming an authority. Most people have a tendency to believe that something an expert says about a topic is true. The victim is more likely to enjoy listening to a trusted and knowledgeable manipulator; this means that if the manipulative individual can bring these two things to the table, they are already on the way to getting their victim to listen and believe them. Persuasion techniques There are techniques that can be utilized so as to make persuasion more successful. All victims are usually presented with different forms of persuasion on a daily basis. A food manufacturing plant will work on getting their victims to purchase a new product, while a movie company will focus on persuading their victims to watch their latest movie projects. There are three main techniques of persuasion that have been prevalent since the birth of this theme. These three techniques of persuasion that give the agent the most value and will be discussed in this section create a need, appeal to social needs, and use loaded images and words. Create a need This is one of the techniques that are often deployed by the manipulator so as to be able to get the victim to change their way of thinking. This creates a need or rather appeals to a need that is already pre-existing within the victim. If it is executed in a skilled way, the victim will be eating out of the persuader's palm in no time. What this means is that the manipulator will need to tap into the fundamental needs of their victim like for example their need for self-actualization. This technique will in most casework so well for the manipulator because the victim is actually going to need these things. Food for example is usually something that we as humans need in order to survive and prolonged lack will pause as a big problem. If the agent can convince the subject that their store is the best, or if they can get more food or shelter by switching their beliefs, there is a higher chance of success. Utilizing illustrative and words The choice of words one chooses to use comes a long way in the success of using persuasion. There are many ways in which you can phrase sentences when actually talking about one thing. Saying the right words in the right way is what will make all the difference when attempting to use persuasion. Tricks used by mass media and advertising The media use two main methods which they use to persuade the masses. First is through the use of images, as well as the use of sounds. Media persuasion by use of images Our sighs and visual processing areas of the brain are very powerful. Just think about it for a minute, have you ever thought of a person without ending up picturing how they look? It is because of this that makes imagery and visual manipulation a preferred method by the media. Companies will often include split-second images of their product or individual inserted into an advertisement that seems quite innocent on the face value. This usually a form of subliminal persuasion. These split-second images that are usually assumed for the most part usually end up taking some form of control of the victim, which persuades them to purchase that particular service. Media persuasion by the use of sound Sound is yet another trick that is used by media in the persuasion of unsuspecting victims. Some people usually underestimate the powers that exist within the sound. But answer me this, how many times have you heard a song somewhere only to have it loops through your mind continuously? Songs usually have an influence on us even though we are not aware of it despite knowing you are listening to it. This is what the media tend to exploit in their quest for persuasion of the masses. There will often be a number of phrases skilfully hidden, and repeated in an advertisement song that will most likely convince you to be inclined to prefer one company over the other.an example of this is seen at McDonald's. The melody ‘I’m lovin it ‘is often repeated in a manner that persuades the victims to constantly purchase their meals. CHAPTER THREE: BRAINWASHING What is Brainwashing Brainwashing is basically the process of conniving someone to give up beliefs they had in the past to take on new ideas and values. There are many ways this can be done even though not all of them are considered bad. For instance, if you're from an African country and then move to America, you're often forced to change your values and ideals to fit in with the new culture and environment you're in. Many people have misunderstandings of what is brainwashing. Some people have more paranoid ideas about the practice, including mind control devices sponsored by the government, which are thought to be easily turned on as a remote control. On the other hand, there are sceptics who don't believe brainwashing is possible at all and lying to anyone who claims it has happened. Most of the brainwashing practice will land in the middle of these two ideas somewhere. During brainwashing practice, the subject will be persuaded by a combination of different tactics to change their beliefs about something. During this process, there is not only one approach that can be used, so it can be difficult to put the practice in a clean little box. The subject will mostly be separated from all the things they know. From there they will be broken down into an emotional state that makes them vulnerable prior to the introduction of new concepts. As this new information is absorbed by the subject, they will be rewarded for expressing thoughts and thoughts that go with these new thoughts. The rewarding is what is going to be used to reinforce the on-going brainwashing. Brainwashing is not a new thing for society. These techniques have been used by people for a long time. Those who were prisoners of wars, for example, were often broken down in a historical context before being persuaded to change sides. Some of these most successful cases would turn the inmate into a very fervent convert to the new side. In the beginning, these practices were very new and would often be enforced depending on who was in charge. The brainwashing term has been developed over time and some more techniques have been introduced to make the practice more universal. The techniques have been introduced to make the practice more universal the newer techniques would rely on the psychology field as many of those ideas were used to demonstrate how persuasive people could change their minds. The brainwashing process is accompanied by many steps. It’s not something that's just going to happen to you as you go down the street and talk to someone you've just met. First of all, one of the main requirements that come with successful brainwashing is to keep the subject isolated. If the subject can be around other people and influences, they will learn how to think as an individual and there will be no brainwashing at all. Once the subject is isolated, they will go through a process of breaking down their own self. They’re told all the things they know are wrong and they're made to feel like they're all wrong. The subject will feel like they're bad after months of going through all of this, and the guilt will overwhelm them. Upon reaching this point, the agent will begin to lead them to the desired new system of beliefs and identity. The subject will be led to believe that all of the new choices are their own and therefore sticking is more likely. The entire brainwashing process can take several months to even years. It's not something that's going to happen in a conversation and it's not going to be able to happen outside of prison camps and a few isolated cases for the most part. For the most part, when someone is just trying to persuade them from a new point of view, those who undergo brainwashing did so. For instance, if you're in an argument with a friend and they're convincing you their ideas make sense, you've been through brainwashing technically. It may not be evil, of course, and you could logically think about it all, but you were still convinced to change the beliefs you had before. It is very rare for someone to undergo true brainwashing where they will be replaced by their entire value system. It will usually occur in the process of coming to a new point of view, irrespective of whether or not the tactics used were forcible. Techniques used in brainwashing Brainwashing is not always as intense as described in this section. The described methods are used for "real brainwashing" and are rarely used. There are many other brainwashing types that actually occur every day. Maybe they don't make you abandon your old identity completely in favour of a new one, but they help to shift your thinking and thoughts about what is going on around you. This section will focus on some of the tactics frequently used during the brainwashing process whether or not it is true brainwashing. Hypnosis is sometimes a form of brainwashing. Basically, hypnosis leads to a high degree of suggestibility. This is often thinly disguised as meditation or relaxation. During the hypnosis process, the agent can suggest things to the individual in the hope that they act or react in some manner. Many people know hypnosis from the stage shows they saw. It is often also used as a means of improving health. Everybody has an innate need to belong to Peer Pressure. This could be with a specific group, family, friends and the community. With the tactic of peer pressure, the doubt is eliminated that the subject feels along with the release of its resistance against new ideas by exploiting this strong necessity. If done properly, the subject may be more willing to experiment with new things, less shy about new people, and make new friends easier. Love Bombing The feeling of family in people is very strong. This is the group into which you were born and which you supposedly have been around for your life. You know better than anyone, and those who missed such a relationship may find that they feel alone and unwanted. The manipulator can create a sense of the family with love bombing, by means of emotional connection, feeling and sharing and physical touch. This enables the manipulator and the subject to bind in a family manner, making it easier to trade in the new one's old identity. Unbending rules The manipulator's rules are often strict and will not be modified. These rules make it difficult for the victim to think and act by themselves; instead, they will spend time doing exactly what the manipulator tells them to do. There are many different rules that can fit into this category, such as those for disorientation and regression, all the way to how medicines, bathroom breaks, and food are allowed to be used. These rules are in place to control the victim completely during brainwashing. Verbal abuse Verbal abuse is one of the tactics used in the breakup phase. Often the victim gets desensitized when bombarded constantly with abusive and foul language. Physical abuse can sometimes supplement or replace verbal abuse. Controlled approval The manipulator will work to maintain confusion and vulnerability during the break-up period. One way to do this is by means of controlled approval. The manipulator will punish and recompense similar actions, in turn, making it difficult for the victim to know right Rejecting old values The manipulator is trying to persuade the victim to denounce all of his values, as mentioned a little earlier in this chapter this process is accelerated by bullying, physical threats and other means. In the end, the subject will denounce the values and beliefs that it once held and begin to accept the manipulator's new way of life. Confusing Doctrine This tactic will encourage the blind acceptance of the new identity while rejecting other logic the victim will possess. To do so, the manipulator is given a complex set of lectures on a doctrine that is unintelligible. Through this process, the subject will learn to blindly believe what the agent says, whether it concerns the doctrine or a new identity that is being created. Metacommunication This tactic is used when the manipulator inserts subliminal messages into the victim. This is done when the agent emphasizes certain words or phrases which are essential to the new identity. The phrases and keywords are implanted into confusing lengthy lectures through which the subject is forced to sit. No Privacy Privacy is a privilege that many victims will lose until they have become a new identity. This is not only taken as a way of making guilt and misdeeds more visible to the victim, but it also removes the ability of the subject to assess the things that are said logically. If the subject has privacy, he or she will have time to take the information he or she received in private and may find that he or she is untrue or not up to what he or she already believes. Removing this privacy means that the agent or officer is always around and always leads the victims to a new identity. Disinhibition The manipulator encourages the victim to give childlike obedience during this tactic. This facilitates the manipulator's shaping of the subject's mind. The change in diet Changing the food consumed by the victim is another tactic that creates disorientation while increasing the sensitivity of the subject to emotional excitement. When the manipulator drastically reduces the food that the victim is allowed to consume, the nervous system of the victim is deprived of the nutrients needed to prosper. In this category, drugs may also be added to the mix. Games Games are sometimes used to induce greater group dependency. Games will be introduced, and most of them will be a victim to truly obscure rules. In some cases, the victim is not told about the rules and it must be identified or the rules are constantly changing. This tactic gives the agent more control. No questions The victim is not allowed to ask questions during the brainwashing process. Issues promote individual thinking, which is dangerous for the practice of brainwashing. If no questions are allowed, it helps the agent to accept the new identity automatically from the victim. Guilt The victim was told they are bad and all they do is bad. Guilt is a common tactic used by the manipulator to challenge their beliefs and what happens around them. The sins of the former lifestyle of the victim are exaggerated to bring culpability to life and strengthen the need for salvation in the victim. Fear is a powerful motivator and can do much more than the other tactics listed. Manipulators may use fear to maintain the group's desired obedience and loyalty. To do this, the manipulator can threaten the individual's limb, life or soul for anything against the new identity. Deprivation of sleep If you don't have the sleep you need, you will often be vulnerable and disorientated. This can help to create the ideal environment the manipulator seeks during the brainwashing process breakdown and denomination. Moreover, the victims often required to do prolonged physical and mental activities in addition to insufficient sleep in order to speed up the process even more. Dress codes Enforcing a dress code further remove the individuality of the victim and the choice he has to pick his own clothing. Often, the victim is asked to wear the dress code held by the rest of the group during the brainwashing process. Chanting: the agent works towards the elimination of any uncultured ideas in the mind of the victim. One way to do this is by chanting or repeating phrases used by those who follow the new identity. Confession Confession in people who are transforming from their old identity to the new identity is strongly encouraged. During this process, the subject destroys its own individual ego by acknowledging the agent's innermost doubts and personal weaknesses. Once you can let go of these things, the new identity can be introduced. Financial commitments Financial contributions are required in some cases. This can help the officer in many ways. Firstly, the financial commitment enables the subject to rely more on the group because they may burn bridges to their past. In the hope that they can overcome their shame and guilt, they donate different assets whether their car, home, money, or some other financial contribution. They are now attached financially to the new identity. In addition, these financial contributions can be used by the agent to foster its own needs. Pointing your finger If you can point your finger towards another, you will feel righteousness. This is your way to tell the world that you are good by simply pointing out some of the deficiencies in the world. The manipulator may indicate all of the murder, racism, and gulf of the world, before contrasting it with the good of the new identity to which the victim is directed. Isolation When you're isolated from everything around you, it's hard to get outside opinions that may change your mind. That is what the agent is going to try because they don't want to get away with all their work. The brainwashers will be separated from society, friends, families and any other rational references that will change their thinking. CHAPTER FOUR: HYPNOSIS What is Hypnosis There have been many definitions about what hypnosis actually is. Hypnosis has been defined by the American Psychological Association as a cooperative interaction where the hypnotist will give suggestions to the person, he picks which he or she will respond to. Edmonton said that a person is simply but in a deep state of mind when in undergoing hypnosis. Hypnosis is therefore when a person enters a state of mind in which a person finds himself or herself vulnerable to the suggestions of a hypnotist. Hypnosis is not new to us because many people have seen it in movies, cartoons or actually been to magic shows or performances where participants are told to do usual acts and they do it. One thing is for sure that, some people do believe that hypnosis actually exist and would do anything to avoid being a victim while others believe that its fiction. Induction Induction is considered as stage one of hypnosis. There are three stages in total. Induction is aimed at intensifying the partaker’s expectations of what follows after, explaining the role they will be playing, seeking their attention and any other steps needed during this stage. There are many methods used by hypnotists to induce a participant to hypnosis. One of them is the “Braidism” technique which requires a hypnotist to follow a few steps. This technique is named after James Braid. First step would be to begin with finding a bright object and hold it in your left hand and specifically between the middle, fore, and thumb fingers. The object should be placed where the participant will be able to fix his or her stare and maintain the stare. This position would be the above the forehead. It is always important that the hypnotist remind the partaker to keep his or her eyes on the object. If the participant wonders away from the object, the process will not work. The participant should be completely focused on the object. The participant’s eyes will begin to dilate and the participant will begin to have a wavy motion. A hypnotist will know that his participant is in a trance when the participant involuntarily closes his or her eyelids when the middle and fore fingers of the right hand are carried from the eyes to the object. When this does not happen, the participant is begins again being guided that their eyes are to close when the fingers are used in a similar motion. Where therefore, this puts the participant in an altered state of mind he or she is said to be hypnotized. The induction technique has been considered not to be necessary for every case and research has shown that this stage is not as important as previously had been known when it came to the effects of induction technique. Over the years, there have been variations in the once original hypnotic induction technique while others have preferred to use other alternatives. James Braid innovation of this technique still stands out. Suggestion After Induction, the next stage that follows is the suggestion stage. James Braid left out the word suggestion when he first defined hypnosis. He however described this stage as attempting to draw the conscious mind of the partaker to focus on one central idea. James Braid would start by minimising the functions of different parts of the partaker’s body. He would then put more emphasis on the use of verbal and non-verbal suggestions to begin to get the partaker into a hypnotic state. Hippolyte Bernheim also shifted from the physical state of the partaker. This well-known hypnotist described hypnosis as the induction of a peculiar physical condition which increases ones susceptibility to the suggestions by the participant. Suggestions can be verbal or one that doesn’t involve speech. Modern hypnotist uses different form of suggestions that include non-verbal cues, direct verbal suggestions, metaphors and insinuations. Non-verbal suggestions that may be used include changing the tone, mental imagery and physical manipulation. Mental imagery can take two forms. One includes those that are delivered with permission and those that are done none the less and are more authoritarian. When discussing hypnosis, it would be wise if one would be able to distinguish between the conscious mind and unconscious mind. Most hypnosis while using suggestions will try and trigger the conscious mind other than the unconscious mind. While other hypnotists will view it as way of communicating with the unconscious mind. Hypnotists such as Hippolyte Bernheim and James Braid together with other great hypnotists see it as trying to communicate with the conscious mind. This is what they believed. James Braid even defines hypnosis as the attention that is focused upon the suggestion. The idea that a hypnotist will be able to encroach into your unconscious mind and order you around is next to impossible as according to those who belong to Braids school of thought. The determinant of the different conceptions about suggestions has also been the nature of the mind. Hypnotists such as Milton Erickson believe that responses given are normally through the unconscious mind and they used the case of indirect suggestions as an example. Many of the nonverbal suggestions such as metaphors will mask the true intentions of the hypnotist from the conscious mind of the victim. A form of hypnosis that is completely reliant upon the unconscious theory is subliminal suggestion. Where the unconscious mind is left out in the hypnosis process then this form of hypnosis would be impossible. The distinction between the two schools of thoughts is quite easy to decipher. The first school of thought believe that suggestions are directed at the conscious mind will use verbal suggestions while the second school of thought who believe that suggestions are directed at the unconscious mind will use metaphors and stories that mask their true intentions. In general, the participant will still need to draw their attentions to an object or idea. This enables the hypnotist to lead the participant in the direction that the hypnotist will need to go into the hypnotic state. Once this stage of suggestion is completed and is successful, the participant will move onto the next stage. Susceptibility It has been shown that people are more likely to fall prey of the hypnotist tactics than others will. Therefore, it will be noted that some people are able to fall into hypnosis easily and the hypnotist does not have to put so much effort while for some, getting into the hypnotic stage may take longer and require the hypnotist to put quite the effort. While for some even after the continued efforts of the hypnotist they will not get into the hypnotic state. Research has shown where a person has been able to reach the hypnotic state at some point in their lives then it is likely that they will be susceptible to the hypnotist’s suggestions and those who have not been hypnotized or it has always been difficult for them to reach that state then it will be likely that they may never be able to reach that hypnotic state. Different models have been established to determine susceptibility of partakers to hypnosis. Research done by Deirdre Barrett showed that there are two types of subjects that considered being more susceptible to hypnosis and its effects. The two subjects consist of the group of dissociates and fantasizers. Fantasizers are able to easily block out the stimuli from reality without the specific use of hypnosis. They day dream a lot and also spent their childhood believing in the existence of imaginary friends. Dissociates are persons who have scarred childhoods. They have experienced trauma or child abuse and found ways to put away the past and become numb. If a person belongs to this groups finds him or herself day dreaming then it will be associated in terms of being blank and in creation of fantasies. These two groups will have the highest rates of being hypnotized. Types of Hypnosis A hypnotist can use different types of hypnosis a participant. Each of them will use different ways and will help with certain issues. Some types of hypnosis will assist in the area of weight loss while others will be used to help a participant relax. The types of hypnosis are discussed below. Traditional hypnosis This type of hypnosis is very popular and used by hypnotists. It works by the hypnotist making suggestions to the participant’s unconscious mind. The participant that is likely to be hypnotized by this is one who does what he is told and does not ask many or frequent questions. If one was to self- hypnotise themselves, they will do this by using traditional hypnosis. Like we have said this type of hypnosis is very popular and this could be attributed to it does not require much skill and it is not technical. The hypnotist will just have the right words and just tell the participant what to do. This might pose a problem to the hypnotist where the participant is a critical thinker and is able to analyse a given situation. Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) This type of hypnosis gives the hypnotist wide criteria for the methods they can use in the process of hypnosis. The hypnotist is able to save time during the process as the hypnotist will just use the same thought patterns as the one that is creating the problem in the participant. If it is stress for example, the same thought pattern causing this stress will be used to counter the stress. The different types of NLP are discussed below. NLP Anchoring To understand how anchoring works, think of a particular scent. The first time you had that scent you were going through some feeling which the unconscious mind attached these feelings to that scent. Through this, the scent will become the anchor for those particular feelings. Every time you heard the scent, those feelings come rushing back triggered by the unconscious mind. This type of NLP has been useful to hypnotists in the process of hypnosis. If for example you won a prize or some money, the hypnotist will try and recreate those feelings you had when you won the prize. While recreating these feelings, the hypnotist will ensure the participant does an action during this process. Each time the subject does the said action, they will be reminded of those feelings. This type of NLP can be used to motivation a person to accomplish their goals for example if they are trying to be healthier or trying to lose weight. The hypnotist will create a positive anchor that is in line with the mental image of the participant. The mental picture will be that of a sexy slim body. This image will be used as the motivator to start losing weight. NLP Flash This technique should only be done by a certified professional because it is considered to be very powerful and used to alter thoughts and emotions around the unconscious mind of the participant. It is considered helpful to persons who experience chronic stress or are addicted to a substance. Here is what the hypnotist will do; he or she where a person is addicted to a substance instead of it causing some feelings of happiness the act will now cause feelings of pain. Where the person had chronic stress, the cat will bring a sense of relaxation. Those addicted to substances such as cigarettes and alcohol will now feel pain when they take these substances which then can effectively assist them in getting over their addiction. While those undergoing chronic stress will find this technique also very useful as it helps them relax because stress can be very harsh to one’s body. They will be able to know what causes their stress and redirect them to cause feelings of relaxation instead. NLP flash has been effective in getting rid of conditioned responses found in the mind of the subject. A practical example will be a person who enjoys drinking alcohol in events. Whenever this person is at an event even where no alcoholic drinks are being served, he will associate every event to alcohol. When this person goes through NLP Flash, they will be to separate these two events from each other. This means the person will be able to enjoy an event without thinking about alcohol and will be effective when trying to quit consuming alcohol. NLP Reframe This is the third type of NLP that can be used in hypnosis. It aims and works well in helping the participant change the way they behave. The hypnotist, for this work, should be able to comprehend that there is in fact a positive outcome when the behaviour is changed. The focus on the outcome is critical as this is the reason for using this form of NLP in the first place. Despite this, the behaviour chosen to achieve the outcome is not as important. The process involves the hypnotist trying to engage with the unconscious mind of the participant. The end game is to get the unconscious mind to be responsible for the participant’s new chosen behaviour that will help in achieving the secondary gain. This new behaviour will then be more acceptable to the conscious mind of the participant. Ericksonian Hypnosis This type of hypnosis uses stories and metaphors. This hypnosis uses stories and metaphors to create ideas and suggestions in the unconscious mind. This hypnosis is very effective and powerful but the only downside it has it is that it requires someone whose experienced and trained for it to work and be effective. What is the reason behind its efficacy? The reason underlying is that it is able to eliminate any resistance to the suggestions of the hypnotist. The metaphors used will be of two types. The first is called isomorphic metaphors. This is a common metaphor that gives steps to the unconscious mind by presenting s somewhat story to the participant that in the end will have a moral ending. The unconscious mind will be able to link the elements coming from the story and the element of the problem situation. An example of a story with a moral ending is the famous story of the ‘Boy Who Cried Wolf’. This story was told to children to warn them about what would happen when they continuously lie. The children being told this story will be able to link the telling of lies and the boy who is mentioned in the story. They will be able to see that lies can bring problems and that the child will willingly stop lying to avoid problems. The other metaphor is the intersperse metaphor. Here the command explained in the story is not easily understood by the participant outside their unconscious mind. CHAPTER FIVE: DARK NLP What is NLP When you here of the term NLP, what’s the first thing that comes to mind? Probably something straight out of Star Wars right? Well you might be dead wrong. This is an acronym of Neuron-linguistic programming. This is one of the prevalent themes that exist I the quest of persuasion and dark psychology. Over the years, NLP has often had different meanings it could be defied as a particular attitude for a sense of adventure and curiosity to know more about the types of coo=immunization that can influence others as well as ourselves offering us a rare chance to better ourselves or juts grow as individuals.it has also been defined as a methodology purely based on the notion that all the behaviours we have as human beings has a certain structure and process. These processes as well as structures may be replicated, taught, learned as well as changed.it has also been defined as being a theme that has slowly evolved into an innovative technology, which allows us to organise our thoughts and ideas in a way that allows us to organise our thoughts in ways that allow us to achieve a particular set of results that would normally be out of our reach. Perhaps the best and easily understood definition of NLP would be that it is a sort of learning system that develops a particular language through making connections between various senses of your body. It has been in existence for more than 40 years, and proved to be efficient. NLP is not as closed off as you may think since it is such a wide raging discipline that its mostly difficult to encompass all its branches and applications in our short definition. Using this enigmatic theme usually results in the altering or full elimination of existing behaviours if by any chance we are not satisfied by them to a more acceptable set of behaviours. Neuron-linguistic programing is not usually based on the notion of new-age mantras or hanging some herbal trees in your room so as to be more notches with your inner self. This theme of dark psychology is usually based on some solid psychological principle. It is a rapid form of psychological therapy which is capable of addressing the myriad of problems that we are doomed to face in our day to day lives such as depression, some form of phobias or any form of negative habits we may have. This clearly is not an inclination to an esoteric or spiritual approach to problems in the long run; using NLP will improve our effectiveness both in our professional lives as well as our personal lives. Contrary to traditional psychology which is usually all about analysing our problems with a view to finding its root cause, NLP instead focuses on the endless possibilities of how the mind works in order to present results.as human. The thoughts in our minds, the feelings that we have and basically all the actions that we do is essentially what makes us human, and changing of these traits will result in the emergence of a ‘new’ you so to speak. NLP is the art of science and personal excellence. It’s regarded as an art because of the sole reason that every individual usually their own unique personality and distinct style of how we generally do things and can never be captured in words or just techniques. The science bit of it is attributed to the method and process which is used to discover patterns used by outstanding individuals in any field in order to achieve outstanding results. Another name this process may also be referred to is modelling. Any such patterns and techniques which may be discovered in this particular way have over the years been used more in the fields of education, business, sports and counselling for a more effective communication with others, a more detailed mode of personal development and in learning. Have there ever been instances where you have worked so hard on a particular thing and the end result leaves you dumbfounded? Have you ever just been taken aback by what you did and just wondered what and how you did that? NLP usually shows you how to understand and model your own personal feats of success, allowing you to enjoy and have more moments of these euphoric feelings. It’s a way of just discovering your own inner genius. Think of it as a way in which that allows you to bring out the best in yourself and in the people around you. This is a practical skill that has the setting of creating your desired results in the world, while at the same time creating values for other people. It is generally the study of what separates excellent and average, leaving behind a trail of efficacious techniques for education and business. Neuro-linguistic programing usually refers to the three most important facets in creating our human experience. The neurological system regulates how our bodies tend to function, the language usually decides on how we communicate and interact with others in our day to day lives, while the programing usually a dominant factor of all the images and models of the world we create for ourselves. Broken down, NLP seeks to describe the overall relationship between the mind, and language and the impact they have on our body and behaviour. Basic psyching seeks to divide the mind into three essential parts namely, the ego, the id and the superego. This three seem to resonate between all models in al psychological literature and practice. NLP atoll has these three models, but it takes a more metaphorical extensible and positive approach. The process of NLP proposes that the inner most internal parts should be well undersold used in a strictly metaphorical sense rather than a literal fact. Besides from the few discussed features, NLP has some other distinct features that we shall briefly mention. NLP is not usually based on any statistics. The reason for this is that statistics may not be able to predict a person’s subjective experience. This is because human beings' subjective experiences are not understood by the external sensory experience. Another distinct feature of NLP is that it is not linier. This enigmatic theme sent usually limits itself to any particular linear cause effect thinking. This happens to be so because it has a preference for whole system thinking. This system tends to be self-organising and too complex for useful linear cause- effect analysis. Another feature is that it is not Aristotelian. What does this mean? It has been defined over the years as a process and structure oriented and not really classification oriented. NLP on a basic is more geared towards putting people into categories based on their personality types rather than assisting them to grow and heal. NLP can also be said to be really efficient.as is now familiar to you; NLP usually does not pursue case effects of an unresolvable nature. Such question-answer sequences like... Why? NLP prefers to ask a useful set of questions such as how? What? When? Who? Since this has few expectations. It is of the view that taking the long personal history of the individual for some casual analysis is basically a colossal waste of time. It will, however, opt to take that route when it is absolutely appropriate direct as it’s presently coded in a person’s mind. This dark theme has a set of powerful tools that when utilized correctly by the individual who has come across them can make some drastic positive change to their on-going experience of personal history as well as its meaning, patterns which emerged as a result of one’s own life experiences and other factors connected with their past. This is however devoid of the use of any drugs, hypnosis or years of analysis. NLP is non-reductionist. NLP considers reductionism such as the belief that our feelings and experiences are just the results of genetics or just chemical processes in the Brain. This is usually resultant of the linguistic confusion as a theme, NLP can be considered to some level as being post-Newtonian. What this means is that NLP has a solid footing in the advances in physics that took place in the late 20th century, which observe that the universe is usually made up of processes and patterns as opposed to a collection of objects or things. The last feature is that NLP does not seem to share the same definition as psychology. This is particularly true if you look at the behavioral point of view. Here, behaviors include thought structures like values and beliefs, memory, sensory representations, linguistic structures in thinking etc., none of which have the capability of being directly observed externally. Yet absolutely no reasonable person would deny the very importance and meaning of internal experiences in our lives. How to use NLP in purchase Establish rapport The first element of the report is the way people move quickly. Have you ever noticed that people tend to move at certain speeds? They move at some speeds. It is about how information is processed-whether visually, through auditing, or kinaesthetically. So, if you meet someone, for instance, who is extremely visual and you're not quite there, you're sitting in your chair, breathing from the top of your lungs and being excited. Or at least act in a way that corresponds to what they do. On the other hand, if you meet someone who is a little more audacity, you want to slow down a little, modulate your voice a little more and 'listen, really listen.' And talk about feelings to them. Actually, alter your voice so it fits yours and "get a feeling of it." The second element in the relationship is the physical reflection of the physiology of the individual. Actually, copying their postures physically, facial expressions, hand gestures, and motions and blinding the eyes will cause their bodies to say to them subconsciously, "Hey, (s) he’s like me!” The nervous system is undeniable. The third element is to match their voice: The tone, tempo, timbre (quality of the voice), and the volume. You can also match their keywords. Perhaps, they often say, “Actually.” You can use it in a sentence several times. Say it back to them. The fourth aspect is to match the breathing, simply to speed up someone's breathing, precisely as they do - to match the breath in and out. The fifth element is to match the size of the information parts in your speech. Please remember that when you start using these advanced communications means, that none of these modes of operation in another person is correct or incorrect, they are just how people work. You also want to maintain in mind that individuals are best contacted when you interact with them in the manner, they process data in order to be a master communicator. You can also match the predicates and predicate phrases of a person. Look now and notice the words and phrases used by individuals in every major system of representation. In each significant scheme of representation, individuals use distinct terms, distinct sentences that show what's happening within their heads. You can also ask questions when you start to notice and use this. Ask questions The second step is questioning. Of course, the first and second steps will take place simultaneously. You can report simultaneously when you ask questions. I don't mean to ask one or two questions; I mean to ask enough questions until you see what the individual is going to purchase. Please ask them questions about what they will purchase. As you ask questions, you should suppose they will purchase whatever you sell, and all you need to do is ask sufficient questions so that you can see how they will purchase it. This particular sales process is a question-making process and a one-on - one communication with your customer. And through relations and questions you get into one-on - one communication. When you ask questions, you need to be truly interested. You need to be interested, not interesting. Establish value The value-finding process begins in finding a need or opportunity that can be filled by your product or service. If you have discovered a need or opportunity to ask questions, then you will determine the value or opportunity of a solution to the problem. Finally, the value of your product or service is linked to the need of the buyer. This is a truly significant step. By the way, the way I like to ask the questions is ' You can see any value to you...' Suppose he feels like too many people are waiting for the computer to use, and it is always tied up. You can say, "Can you see any value in getting your computer to function quicker?” The issue is, “Can you see any significance?” That is how I ask: “Can you see any value for yourselves?” And in this event the price would be quicker or less waiting time for the computer. Or he may find that people are always waiting to come to the computer, and you may isolate that it is perhaps because it takes so long to print. Then you can tell him, "Do you see any importance in printing being unattended where you can dump the whole thing in a buffer and printing without supervision?” Close When you find a need or opportunity, identify the value of a solution, link the need and the solution and anchor it, then close the solution. Handle the objection This is done in mainly two ways. You may either chose to ignore the objection, or you can simply choose to answer the objection. Induction Some of the non-state theorists saw this phase somewhat differently. Instead they see this stage as a way to raise the expectations of the participants on what will happen, to determine the role they will play, to focus their attention in the right direction and to take any other steps needed to take them in the right direction for hypnosis. During hypnosis, there are several induction techniques. Braid's "eye-fixation" technique or "Braids" is the most known and influential method. You need to follow a few steps to use the Braid induction techniques. The first is to take any bright object like a watch case and hold it between the centre, forehead and thumb fingers on the left hand. This object is about 8-15 inches from the participant's eyes. Hold the object somewhere above the forehead to make the eyelids and eyes stressed during the process so that the participant can always maintain a fixed look at the object. The hypnotist must then tell the participant that he should always keep his eyes fixed on the object. The patient must also fully concentrate his mind on the idea of that particular object. You must not think of other things or allow your minds and eyes to wander or the process will not succeed. After a short period of time, the eyes of the participant begin to expand. With a little more time, the participant starts to take a wavy move. When the middle and forefingers of the right side unwillingly close their eyes, they are in trance, when the middle and forefingers of the right hand are carried from the eyes to the object. If not, the participant has to start again; make sure the participant knows they have to allow their eyes to close once the fingers are carried back to the eyes in a similar movement. This will cause the patient to enter the altered state of mind called hypnosis. How to use NLP in relationships and manipulative people Now that we know all that NLP entails, let us see how it can be used in relationships. The first way this theme can help you better your relationship, is by enabling you to be a good listener. NLP enables you to show a more sincere interest in whatever may be happening in the other persons own life. Another way NLP betters relationships is by making you put yourselves in another person’s shoes. Being in the world of the other person requires you to listen openly. In other words, you're listening and you're just listening. This can take some practice since most individuals tend to listen partly while preparing or rehearsing what they say next internally. NLP also allows you to not focus on the bad side of a person but instead so the good. There are many of them, and you have a decision to pay more attention to their fine points or imperfections. The more you find the fine points of a person and concentrate on them, the greater your regard for them. NLP also allows one to be more empathetic rather than sympathetic. Empathy means understanding and feeling their difficulties without trying to engage unless requested. Sympathy, being sorry for them, is disrespectful and shows that you feel that they have no resources alone to deal with their own problems. Relationships are fostered by NLP since they push someone to keep in touch with their loved ones. Even if you were together several hours before, maybe at breakfast, how about a one-minute telephone call, asking how your day is going and telling you to think about them? Or a one-line email or text email? Keep in touch with those at a distance, too. If nourished, long-distance relationships may last for decades. The connection will be maintained and maintained by the occasional letter, card, telephone call or email. NLP makes it easier for one to accept the flaws of others. Identify and tolerate the weaknesses and imperfections of a person. After all, "weaknesses" are subjective assessments based on your view of the world. And remember that there are no perfect people-most of us work from time to time to reduce the number and magnitude of our imperfections-this is a lifelong project. This broad theme makes it possible for you to respect and accept the point of view of others. Recognize that we see stuff otherwise. We all have a distinct perspective of the globe. This perspective or model of reality is based on our previous experience of life. There is no' correct' or' false' world view- it is a matter of opinion, and so will your opinions alter from time to time. By taking the time to learn about their ever-changing view of the world, you might learn things to enrich or extend your own. NLP will finally make you accept someone as they are without having the urge to change who they are. This is a particularly frequent failure in life partnerships. Remember that, because of their potential to be the person you wanted to be, you did not choose the individual. You got together because you enjoyed each other and concentrated only on the stuff you knew about them in the first wave of love. How, then, are we beginning to live together or marry and starting to crowd up the' good points ' lists, becoming increasingly obsessed with listing and reminding them that we don't like things about them? CHAPTER SIX: BODY LANGUAGE Body language cue When you try to know more about your goal and how they view the world, body language is going to be so crucial. Too many times we get caught in the words that someone else tells us and we won't concentrate on the other indications they also give us. There is so much that can be disclosed by these body language clues, and it makes a large difference how effective you are in understanding and working with your goals. Body language will refer to some of the nonverbal signals we use to interact with others. These nonverbal signals will take up much of the interaction we communicate every day. From the movement of our body to our facial expressions and everything in between, things we don't say can still share a ton of information during the process. Indeed, 60 to 65% of our interaction could be accounted for by body language and other nonverbal communications. So how do we learn to read this language to our own advantage? Let's begin by learning more about the various indications of body language, and how we can read this for our benefit. First off we have the facial expressions. Think of a time, by the expression on your face, about how much data someone can convey. A smile is a nice way to show happiness or consent. A frown can imply the other way around. In some instances, facial expressions can show our real emotions about a scenario. While an individual may say he's okay, he looks like he's talking when he says this might talk otherwise. There are many feelings on our facial expressions, including: 1. 2. 3. Contempt Desire Excitement 4. 5. Confusion Fear The expression that appears on the person's face helps us to determine if we trust and think anything the person says. In reality, one research discovered that the most credible of all facial expressions will be a small eyebrow raise and a slight smile. This is an expression that in many instances shows us to trust and friendliness. The other type of body language cue will have to be the mouth. Mouth expressions and motions can be another vital component of body language reading. For instance, if you notice someone else chewing on his bottom lip, it may show that there are feelings of insecurity, fear, and worry. The individual can cover his mouth to be polite when he coughs, but sometimes the other person's disapproval. And smiling will be one of the best signals of corporeal language, but the smile and what it says about a person can be evaluated differently. Some of the stuff you can care about when reading someone else's mouth movements include; Pursed lips: If you see your goal tightened up, it's a sign of distrust, disagreement, and disgust. Lip biting: This is when you bite your lower lip, usually when you are stressed, anxious, or distressed. Mouth cover: Any moment someone wishes to conceal one of their emotional responses, they can cover their mouths in order to assist. Turned up or down: Even a slight shift in your mouth can be a subtle indication of how you feel right now. When your mouth turns up, it's a sign that you are hopeful or glad. It could be a grimace, disagreement, and even sorrow when the mouth turns down. Another area to observe as body language cue is gestures. Gestures can be a very evident, direct sign of body language to be careful about. Waiving, pointing and fingering can be common and easy to understand gestures. Some may even be cultural. Some of the most popular gestures and the significances that come with them include: A clung fist: In most cases, this will show anger, but sometimes it can also imply solidarity. Up or down thumbs: This is used as a sign of approval and disapproval. The "all correct" gesture: This one will assist others to say you're fine in the United States. But it is seen in some other cultures as a vulgar gesture. The next thing we have to do is look at the arms and legs of the individual you talk to. These can be useful if a lot of information is to be transmitted nonverbally. Crossing the weapons will often be a defensive maneuver. Crossing the legs away from another individual will also show a person's discomfort or a dislike. Other subtle signals, including the large expansion of the arm, can sometimes help us to seem bigger and more comfortable while maintaining the arms close to the body. When you try to measure your body language a little, be careful about some of the following signals that your legs and arms will transmit to you from the target: Crossed arms: This will give you a signal that you're closed, safe and defensive. As a manipulator, you need to uncross the arms of the goal to make you feel comfortable. Standing on hips with your hands: This can be a good sign that the person is ready and controlled. This will sometimes be a sign of aggression. Clamp the hands so that they're behind the back: This will be a sign that your goal is angry, anxious or boring. You have to look at some of the other signals that come first. Tap fingers or fidgeting quickly: The other person is frustrated, impatient and even bored. Crossed legs: This is a good indication that someone feels closed or needs some privacy. Posture is another thing you should look at. The way we hold our bodies will also be a significant component of body language. Posture refers to how we hold our bodies and to a person's general physical shape. Posture can give a wealth of data on how someone feels and also suggests that a person's features are submissive, open or confident. For instance, if you sit directly, it can show that an individual is concentrated and is attempting to look after what is going on. Sitting down with the body, on the other side, will show that someone is most of the time indifferent or bored. Looking at your goal will assist you to understand whether you are interested in what you do or say, or if you need to move on to find a different destination. Whenever you attempt to read some of the languages of your body, attempt and find out some signals that your goal's position is attempting to tell you. Some of them are: Open posture. Open posture. This includes keeping the body's trunk exposed and open. This sort of Closed position: this one will require hiding the body's trunk and hitting the legs and arms. This posture will be more indicative of anxiety, discomfort, and depression in the objective. The eyes clues to revealing true intentions The visual gateway to the globe around us is our eyes. When we are born, we scan for data in the familiar face, motion or novelty, colour, shade, symmetry and always for aesthetic pleasure. Our visual cortex, which is big in ratio to the remainder of the brain, is looking for fresh things and fresh experiences. Our eyes demonstrate love and compassion and fear and contempt. Welcome or happy eyes can create our day. But eyes can also let us know that something is wrong, that issues or issues exist. In a crowd of strangers, the eyes can own space or cower. We adorn our eyes so that we can attract and prevent them. They are usually the first thing we notice in others, and so we spend a lot of time looking at the eyes when a baby is born. Maybe because we really look at their soul through the window. Our pupils expand when we are comfortable, or like something or someone we meet. We have no control. We have no control over this. If couples are comfortable, their pupils dilate as their eyes attempt to get as light as possible. This is why dimly lit restaurants are excellent places to meet, as it softens the eyes and increases the size of the students, which makes us relax even more around others. Signs of the shoulders neck and hips Shoulders Whether they are broad, narrow, athletic, slim, attractive, beguiling, or slumping, our shoulders speak volumes about us. Some identifiers will be explained below. An ear-raised shoulder when an individual answers a question is generally insecurity or doubt. In combination with other behaviours, this indicates well that a person lacks trust in what he says (hesitation in answering, arms drawing closer to the body). When a party raises a single shoulder in negotiations in reaction to a question such as "Is that your best price? It usually indicates that there is space for negotiation. A one-shoulder response indicates that there is no complete commitment to what is said. The slow, deliberate increase of one shoulder combined with a bent head to the same shoulder while making direct contact with the eye represents a private interest. We generally see this in dating circumstances, generally in females who look like someone. When individuals are asked a question and do not understand the response, they lift rapidly and prominently both shoulders. The swift upward motion is serious conduct that is defiant. In this situation, these are generally associated with favourable feelings. This is more honest than a slow shrug (as "I don't know" reply) or a shrug with only one shoulders hesitating. Neck Beyond a scratch, neck touch is a good measure of insecurity, fear, anxiety, concerns or problems. However, we tend to touch our neck slightly if something disturbs us or concerns us. Neck touch is often ignored in all its forms and yet it's one of the most accurate when it comes to exposing something that bothers us. The touch or covering of the "neck dimple" or suprasternal notch (the region of the indented throat under the Adam apple and just above the upper thorn) shows concern, concern, worry, insecurity or anxiety. Men tend to grab or cover this area robustly by their hands while adjusting or grabbing their collar. Women touch this region more often than males, and with the tips of their fingers they tend to do so more lightly. Whether delicately or forcefully, the weakest point of the body means something is at stake. When we feel threatened, our neck developed most probably as a consequence of the innumerable encounters our species experienced numerous acts of predation by the big felines which generally go for the neck. See What every body is saying for more data. Playing with a collar is used by females to cover the dimple neck with the hand. It protects a susceptible region and alleviates stress by repeated motion. The front shirt collar is used for pacification or alleviating strain in three respects: by covering the neck region; as tactile repetitive conduct; and by shifting clothes to vent the skin below. Hips Hip swivelling is a way to deal with stress, boredom or exhaustion in a single location. People could do this, either when their feelings are rallied or afterward, in controversial discussions, as a method of calming down. You rarely see this with couples at an early stage; they tend to appear, if any, on the path when problems are discussed. Under pressure, individuals are rubbed as a pacifier by their hips and legs. It is also used for drying sweaty hands when you feel nervous. You see this gesture as learners prepare for an exam or as people pass customs. Persons under psychological stress can rock back and forth on the hips while sitting. Serious stress such as witnessing a loved one's death will trigger this conduct, which pacifies with its repetitive movement. This conduct could also be seen in individuals with certain mental illnesses such as autism. If we're bored, we might stand and swing our hips, as if we were cradling and sleeping a child. Swinging our hips leads our inner ears to move fluid and hair, and it is a very calm feeling. This is distinct from the forward and back hip-torso rocking. Mimic body language Mimicking is a social phenomenon in which people imitate the posture, gestures, and words of another person. Often it is unconscious conduct-we rarely know this when we do-but it's a sign that individuals are in harmony and synchronization with one another. When two persons look at each other, it demonstrates convenience, trust, and relationship between them. Long-term friends and romantic couples are especially attuned. You will often notice couples mirror themselves as they communicate if you ever go to a populous pubic region, such as a park, a mall or a busy road. As social humans, it is part of our basic nature. For instance, in my apartment, I have a balcony over a busy road in Brooklyn. It's a nice place for me to observe human behaviour casually. One prevalent thing I discover is that couples walk in a lock. They move in ideal synchrony with their correct and left foot, like a marching band. They also tend to look at each other and look away simultaneously. They literally appear to be linked. Mimicking can be seen in many respects as taking a viewpoint or empathy. Previous studies in psychology show that our bodies show a lot about how we are thinking and feeling ("embodied cognition" is the word for this). Thus, if we adopt the positions and body language of another individual, we can better understand what another individual experiences from their view. Not only do you like to see yourself reflected, but it's also deeper than that. Mimicking demonstrates readiness to comprehend and communicate with someone truly. CHAPTER SEVEN: COVERT EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION The first step to fully understanding dark psychology as a whole is by first fully grasping what covert emotional manipulation is. This because many techniques of dark psychology we shall talk about in this book often makes use of covert emotional manipulation in more than one specific way. Learning more about this particular theme will grant you a higher understanding of what it actually consists of as well as recognizing its v various manifestations across the board. This is, therefore, a very crucial step in understanding this wider topic of dark psychology in general. What then have people often beloved covert emotional manipulation to be? This is defined as an attempt by an individual to influence the thoughts Feelings of another person in a sneaky yet undetectable way. Breaking down each of the three keywords will perhaps assist in handling the very base of this theme. Covert simply refers to the way that these manipulators are able to hide their true nature as well as intentions from their target victim. Not all emotion manipulation, however, can classify as being of a covert nature. The victims to this type of emotional manipulation will in most cases not be aware that they are being controlled from the shadows, nor aware of the manipulator's motivation as to why he is doing it. The emotional part of this theme refers to the specific focus of the manipulator. Other possible types of manipulation usually include people’s will power, beliefs, and behaviours. This type of manipulation is mainly cantered on impacting a person’s emotional state as well as their perception of reality. A majority of the manipulators dwell on this area the most since they will often lead to them fully grasp a person’s emotions seeing that they are the gateway to all the other aspects of their personality. This ultimately makes the manipulator take full control of the victim from the word go. Manipulation is the final piece to covert manipulation of this rather complicated puzzle. Manipulation is generally misunderstood and is that it is totally the same as influence. This could not be further from reality as manipulation is often referred to as the concealed process of undue influence that is said to have occurred outside the consciousness of the individual who has fallen prey to control. There are also distinct intentions for both manipulation and impact that drive them. An individual who regards himself as an influencer will often try to help a person in one manner or another only in general. A manipulator is a reverse opposite since their purpose is to regulate their victims secretly for their own gain, mostly without consideration for their victim. Therefore, in the difference between whether or not a specific action is of a manipulative nature, intention is something important to consider. More generally speaking, situations, where this type of manipulation can be used, are within the scope of the private, professional, romantic and family life of an individual. Romantic covert emotional manipulation is undoubtedly the most lethal and common type of emotional manipulation. But once toy understands both its fundamental idea and its practical adaptations, you will at least be able to erect mechanisms that can be used to protect yourself against this regardless of the scenario in which you are. Just like these prevalent cases where it is frequently manifested, there are also some prevalent kinds of people who express the thoughts that support covert emotional manipulation. The trick to understanding this theory fully will require one to be able to find a relationship between this complex theory to the actual individual portrayals of its ideas.one such example of these personal portrayals of stealthy manipulation is in the broad field of relationships. Normally, if two people are in a relationship and one notices that the other is trying to assert a certain type of control. In one way or another, the victim of this attempted control often chooses to leave said relationship since that is a line crossed.it is because of this very reason that, that most manipulators decide not to be open on their approach but instead approach manipulation in a very clandestine manner. The victim often gets subjected to complete emotional manipulation, without having to realize what is going on. This is often beneficial to the manipulator since he is able to get his heart’s desire of controlling another person while at the same time managing not to lose the victim. A friend may use this sort of manipulation, and not only romantic relationships to get whatever they are out of friendship. This is frequently implemented to plant the seeds of guilt, compassion, and guilt towards themselves within the victim. There will be no singing le clue to the friend in this scenario as to whether or not they are being manipulated. Because of this impact, the victim may not usually be able to understand why they may feel or behave towards the so-called' friend' in some manner. Covert emotional manipulation also is seen at play in the professional world. Since the beginning of time, employees have raised the issue of having certain superiors who have made them at one time or the other, feel a certain unexplainable feeling of fear, duty or overall guilt. Due to the busy nature of these professionals, they are often oblivious as to the reason these feelings exist within them, as well as where they seem to originate from. The most delicate situation we will discuss is the family dynamic scenario. This is an extremely difficult situation since, because they share blood, one could never suspect a family member. Being manipulated by one's own flesh and blood usually has serious server outcomes for a victim because of the level and intensity they are likely to be influenced by. The issue we are asking ourselves is how these manipulators succeed in inculcating such extreme amounts of control over their victims? Usually this is seen to be implemented using a number of otherwise diabolical tactics that are both difficult to identify and difficult to withstand. One such tactic is known as the love bombing tactic. This put simply is merely the tactic involving the intense, sudden and powerful display of favourable feeling towards their victim.it is essential to remember that manipulators generally deploy this tactic at the very beginning of their communication with their victims. This tactic seems a little odd when you actually think about it. This is because an individual who intends to harm their victim is not anticipated to be intensively positive at first. Well, if it is to serve their own selfish interest, why not? The theory behind this is quite easy because its main aim is to generate an otherwise intense impression of affection, trust, and compliance for the manipulator within a victim. The extent to which love bombing is used as well as the person on which it will often be used relies on whether the situation is assessed by the manipulators. What am I going to mean here? Take a person, for example, who seems to be very desperate, hopeless and solitary. The manipulator is more likely to choose this person as his victim as he is conscious that, as opposed to their more fulfilled counterparts, they will be extremely receptive to him... Two very important things may be learned from the above definition above. Two very important lessons about covert emotional manipulation can be seen to be introduced to us. The first lesson is the flawless nature and use of covert emotional manipulation. If let’s say someone with an intention of harming another person, might tell you “this person was really good to me. We should all hang out together sometime “how could you be able to release this as a type of love bombing at first glance? This is basically any particular negative outcome is more often than not presented in the most positive ways. The second lesson we derive from this is that emotional stealth manipulation can be presented in distinct ways depending on the specific position of the victim. For this, a qualified manipulator with some experience is best suited as they understand the ideal timing of how and when to deploy this method in any specified situation. Let's look at an instance of this being used on a daily basis. Normally, when provided with donations and presentations at events, whether it's birthday parties, commitment parties, etc. Someone inexperienced will attempt to use this without knowing exactly they are doing and end up failing even before they actually started. They are supposed to know the extent to which his victim is likely to respond to certain techniques more than others. Another technique to this is known as imminent positive reinforcement. This is a technique that usually involves controlling a victim without them having any knowledge of that. This is generally the flow of activities from love bombing, directly followed by positive reinforcement then finally intermittent positive reinforcement. Why is this so? Love bombing has the purpose of lowering the victim’s defences, which I turn increases their reliance on the person manipulating them. This sets the dream of a positive relationship or friendship. Another tactic often employed by the manipulator is known as triangulation. This is an effective tactic in the arsenal of a manipulator in which he creates a relationship between you, him or her, and some other third party... The main goal of this is to make a victim feel somewhat uncertain about the relationship, leading the victim to have an intense love for the manipulator that just makes them stay together for a longer period of time talking about an old lover they had, or just bringing up someone they often meet randomly at the gym. Their primary interest is in generating insecurity for their victims. If you create subtle, unfavourable comparisons between you and the outside individual, it makes it much worse. They will deny interest in the other person if you confront them and tell you that the real problem is your insecurity or low self-esteem. Where did you hear before that? It is not unusual for the manipulator to treat the other person as his next destination while using him conveniently. Another devious tactic used to deploy covert mind control is known as insinuating. The primary objective of this is to create a victim feel somewhat unsure about the relationship, leading the victim to have an intense love for the manipulator that just makes them remain together for a longer period of time speaking about an ancient friend they had, or just bringing up someone they often meet randomly at the gym. Their main interest is to magnify their victim's insecurity. It makes it much worse if you generate subtle, unfavourable comparisons between you and the person outside... Your partner smiles as an example and says, "What do you know? As a prostitute, you could make a lot of money!” After having sex with him. He'll tell you when you ask him that he meant it as a compliment. But for a long time to come, you're going to wonder what he really meant. You may wonder why your partner when he was in bed with you was thinking about prostitutes; why he understands so much about prostitution in the first location; what he really believes about you; and how much you should put on the bill that you are tempted to give him. And you'll also wonder if he'd just compliment you on how great, as he said a lover, he believes you're. Such remarks are going to work on you and provide the fuel for plenty of resentment, future arguments, and relationship insecurity. Positive reinforcement is the next step engaged in the search for love bombing. This can be described as the general behavioral switch whereby the specific manipulator does not attempt to show any unconditional positivity towards the victim. He does this until required conduct is performed by the victim. Maybe an instance will shed some light on this issue. If a manipulative guy begins to court this lovely woman, let's say, he meets in a coffee shop. If he wishes this woman to call him regularly, all he has to do is demonstrate that he has no more immediate impression, which leads her to call him to fulfil his wish. He will only exhibit a positive reaction when this happens. The victim will be in such a deep psychological manipulative trap, that they won’t be able to tell if that the positivity is being used against them. All these are all factors that make the victim subservient to the wishes of the manipulator in order to experience the good feeling is that are available on offer. CHAPTER EIGHT: FAVOURITE VICTIMS OF MANIPULATORS Behavioural traits Manipulators are often socially withdrawn individuals who have a macabre notion of what human relationships usually work. The main form of connections with others with the intention of using them for their own personal gain. Who then can be said to be the preferred victims for these manipulators? Manipulators often tend to be drawn to two particular sets of individuals. The first group is those that desire some certain level of love, as well as those people in relationships. Love is universal. Love is universal. It is an instinctively desired primordial emotion. We are designed for love as human beings. We love and feel loved. We love. No one is as happy as a man or a woman in love who knows that they are in exchange loved. Some people work together for procreation. Some people squat to deny social pressure. Some even foster the alliance of powerful families. However, the main reason for relationships is love. Having said that, it is easy to degrade things to the point when love is used as a negotiating chip for more power over another person. And this is where dark psychological elements come to play. You heard the saying "use what you're supposed to get”. This kind of thinking comes with the terrain in the business world. But in relationships, manipulation is called. Let’s look at this example. A woman knows she is sexually attractive and irresistible to her partner. Maybe there's been something she wanted from him for a long time, but despite long discussions, she couldn't achieve her willingness to comply. Let's say what she always wanted of him is his physical contribution to the work of the house. His stubborn position leads her to devise a way of making her partner compliant. She has to do it without saying anything like "vacuum the living area or there will be no sex tonight." Although this has been known to happen in some houses, it would certainly backfire especially if you deal with people who are not naturally fond of being instructed by others regardless of how well it is phrased. She bids her time instead. She hangs on him when she finds him in the middle of a random chore. She gives him sweet praises and says things like how she finds him so appealing when she does and then she indulges in her sexual longing. The impact of this tactic is even greater if he usually "work" to excite her. If she does this consistently, he subconsciously receives the message that he could do homework for good sex afterward. Over time, he is programmed to do the work that his partner naturally refused to do because of sexual motivation. This is an apparently harmless scenario. But dark psychology has been used here if you observe closely. The fella was manipulated for sex to do things, though willingly. She understood and played her strength to get what she wanted. The good thing is that everyone is happy in this case. Because the woman gets her partner's valuable contribution, and the man gets the sex he wants with a woman he desires. But when it comes to dark psychology, things are not always mutually beneficial. For the victim, this can get really dark. Let’s look at this other pair. I'd call this new Dave and Maya couple. Dave and Maya have very contrasting characters. Dave is a housemate and Maya is a lively extrovert with many friends. On the surface, it seems that their personality differences perfectly complement each other. Dave felt that he needed to exercise more control of Maya. But he knows (probably because he's tried it already) that he can't use full force to get what he wants. Therefore, he starts a campaign to get Maya under his thumb. He begins with picking small details about her like her choice in clothing, make-up and hair and of course, makes snide remarks about her weight in love. This affects her trust and when she brings up her friends, she uses flimsy events to illustrate and back up her theory of fictional feuds among them. These small seeds of doubt grow and thrive to a coin that further divides Maya and her friends. Because of her newly found lack of confidence, she feels that Dave is the only one who really cares about and accepts her for whom she is.This makes Dave want to do all she can to put her exactly where he wants her to be... under his thumb and totally under his control. In both cases, we see instances in which relationships supposed to be between the two involved people become a way to fulfil the wishes of a partner by manipulation and disappointment. Both relations began with good intentions and, although for both parties the end result of the former was satisfactory, in the later story it was the opposite. The similarities here are that all the victims did what they did for their partners. Therefore, our desire to be loved can make us vulnerable. It can be manipulated and used for other people's gains. The other group of people that manipulators tend to have an affinity towards is those individuals who seem to have strong religious beliefs. Those overly religious people so to speak are usually seen to follow their teachings devotedly without question. No matter what faith you practice, there is a fact that sometimes our faith creates a blind spot that distorts the reality and causes us to decide that if we were in our right and proper state of mind, probably we would not. But let's see why before we get into what. When I spoke in a previous chapter about vulnerability, I said that what makes us human is something that makes us vulnerable and vulnerable to machinations of dark psychology. These influences are obvious to some people than to others. Even the earliest civilization precedes our belief in deities. Man has always viewed his existence as a small part of the universal scheme of things, so we believe there are forces that are greater, larger and more divine. If you looked at things logically, it made sense because it helped our minds deal with the inexplicable things around us. You see a beautiful flower and wonder how exquisite and delicate something can be... without thinking or pattern. We look at the great expanse of heaven and wonder what lies beyond. Is it going forever? Or does it simply tap into an endless end? When you listen to the powerful roar of the waterfall or the sound of a thunder blast, even with the progress and knowledge that we have, we are still terrified in fear and amazement. At that time your choices were either to let fear make you foolish or to streamline the situation by putting it on a sovereign being that is greater than you. Some of the braver people chose science to explain them. Staying with this same line of thinking, we are forced to face our own mortality if someone we love dies. Our sorrow is compounded by life and death questions. Is the journey here finishing or continues into the afterlife? This was a strong motivating force behind today's beliefs. The fear and consideration given to live following this life led many people to make "right choices" here so that when death comes, the life we hope will continue. It is our way to so to speak manipulate the final result because the alternative, as it has been depicted, is so grim. Some people take our fear of the afterlife to manipulate us for what they want. If we hold this theory of afterlife so highly, you can imagine how we treat people who are considered as mouthpieces of the deities who control afterlife. Pastors, imams, rabbis, and all other religious leaders are so reverent that the words of the God concerned are regarded as the words. These religious leaders are generally intended to apply morally sound principles in accordance with their respective offices and act in the best interest of their members. If not, at least for any other reason, to promote the principles of faith which they claim to represent. This is not always the case, however, as we have come to understand. Many religious leaders abuse their roles and influence by deceiving their members to make decisions that serve only their egotistical agenda. The common practice is that the name of the main deity twists the words drawn from the sacred manual of religion to mean new things that confirm whatever the story they are telling to help them manipulate the people successfully. Many people have been swindled, physically hurt and even committed atrocious crimes. Another method these false leaders use is to claim that they have a vision or spiritual insight into a certain need for the victim. They create a complex story that is a mix of lies interwoven with the trust and the main objective is to extortion the victim for money, favour or power play only. Some victims are forced to divide more money than they could ever expect. In some cases, impressive young victims are brainwashed in fear in occult situations. But such scenarios don't just end in religious houses. There are people who don't belong to any religion but want to be spiritually open. These people are fake psychics and mediums who claim to have a strong relationship with the Netherworld. Again, our attachment to dead people and our concerns about what happens after death cloud our judgments and open us up to crooks who would manipulate the situation to their advantage. They use the same trick of false religious leaders to manipulate their victims with disappointment and lies. Victims take a 10-minute psychic reading of their horoscopes and palms to keep their promises, changed realities and false expectations for years. That they spend thousands and thousands of dollars on the search for the elusive "truth." People who hope for science are not immune to manipulation. You cannot be influenced, think again because your faith is anchored in a legible and factual science. When there is a crisis, people come back to what they trust. You naturally turn to science for a scientist. Some people with a weakening health condition are looking for unconventional medicine to survive the disease. As they know that the best of conventional medicine has failed, they turn to those outliers who claim to have the solution for their experimental medications and never have been done before. These procedures are unfortunately too risky, too costly and often uninsured. But every penny is worth the slim chance of life, and this is what the fraudulent people exploit. And it's not only in crisis. You have found wonderful solutions to amass problems like loss of weight and so forth. You argue that your latest dietary fad, pill or technology can transform us using scientific theories not tested and verified. Many people purchase this transformation promise based on information specially manipulated for extorting victims. The main difference between religious leaders and these suppliers of false science is that they use science in swindling their victims instead of a deity. And sadly, most people don't realize how badly they are affected until it’s too late. When it comes to faith, those who use and exploit the dark key to their deepest needs. They use the sacred thing to manipulate your thinking process. And sometimes it doesn't really matter the sacredness. As long as it is important to you, they regard it as some sort of gold mine. And there is no greater time for me or for anyone so to speak than when this person experiences a crisis. This is because, in your moment of crisis, you are at your weakest and most influential and people know how to handle things for their own benefit. CHAPTER NINE: DECEPTION What is Deception Definition is a theme that usually resonates within the spectrum of dark psychology. It has throughout the years been defined as any particular act that is used by a particular manipulative individual in order to instil certain beliefs within the victim that are usually false in nature or only those possessing partial truths.it is usually placed in the same category as deceit, mystification and suffrage. Deception is not usually an easy theme to understand since it involves a lot of different things like for example distractions, propaganda camouflage and concealment. The manipulator is often able to easily control the subject's mind since the victim is often led to placing immense trust in this particular manipulative individual. The victims often believe in whatever the manipulator will say, and might even be basing future plans and shaping their world base on the things that the manipulator is feeding their subconscious mind. This strong element of trust towards the manipulator can quickly fade away once the victim realizes what is going on. It is because of this very reason that a certain level of skill is needed for deployment of this theme, since only then will a manipulator be able to skilfully change the focus of suspicion towards him and onto the victims paranoia. In most cases, deception will often present itself in relationship settings and can lead the victim to have dominant feelings of distrust and betrayal between the partners in the relationship. This usually happens because deception is a theme that violates most of the rules of most relationships, together with having a negative influence on the expectations that come with the relationship. When getting into relationships, one of the things that are usually expected is the ease of having an honest and truthful conversation with their partner at all times. If the then learns that one of them is beginning to show signs of deception, they might have to learn the different ways using misdirection and distractions to pry out reliable and truthful information that they need from them. The trust would have gone into a permanent rift that will not be easy to come back from, since the victim will always be questioning everything that the partner will say and do wondering whether the story is actually true of fabricated. Most relationships will end as soon as the deceptive partner is found out. As we described earlier, this is a form of communication that is reliant on lies and certain omissions to make the victim believe whatever he is being led to believing by the deceptive individual. Seeing as this the case, there are five main types of deceptive tactics that are seen to exist. We shall briefly touch on each one to better understand this theme. Concealments Probably taking home the medal of most used type of deception, concealment is basically when the deceptive individual knowingly omits information from his stories that are often relevant and important to the context .they can also engage in certain behaviours that would signal to hide of relevant information to the subject at that particular time. A skilled manipulator is experienced enough to know that he will have to be clever to know that it’s safe not to be directly in their approach, but rather insinuate the lie leading the victim to their own conclusion which is predetermined. Exaggeration What can be said about this? This is where an individual in a sense stretches the truth a bit too much with an intended goal of leading the story towards a direction that best caters for their needs. The manipulator will make a certain scenario appear to be more severe than it actually is so as to avoid lying directly to their victims. This is usually done so as to let the victim do whatever it is, they want. Lies This is one tactic that we as humans use on a daily basis for one reason or another. We are often inclined to lie as a way to avoid some form of penalty. For example, if you work in the bank and you run late because of something minor, you will be inclined to lie to your boss so as to keep him from cutting you lose. What then can be said to be the meaning of this? This is where an individual gives information that is all south of the actual truth. They will present this completely fabricated truth to the victim and they will believe it. Equivocations This is where an individual will knowingly make a statement of a contra dictionary nature intended to lead the victim to the path of confusion on what is exactly seems to be going on. This is usually a clever tactic will allow the manipulator to save his image if he is later on discovered. Understatements This is where an individual minimizes aspects of the truth in the particular story being told at the time. They will often approach a victim preaching how something isn’t that big of a deal, when in fact it is of the utmost importance. What drives a manipulator to the deployment of the theme of dark psychology? According to research done over the years, there are usually 3 main things that motivate an individual into using deception on others. These three motives are under the umbrella of close relationships. They include self- focused motives, relationship-focused motives and partner-focused motives. Let's look first at the motives focused on the partner. The victim will use deception in this kind of motive to avoid harming the subject, or their partner. They may also use deception so as to protect the relationship between the victim and an outside third party, to avoid worrying about something about the subject, or to keep the subject's self-esteem intact. Such motivation for deception will often be seen as both relationally beneficial and socially polite. Next is deception's self-focused motive. This one is not considered as noble as the first one and is therefore considered more inferior to the other techniques. Rather than worrying about the victim and how they feel, the manipulator will simply think about how they feel and their own self- image. The manipulator uses the deception to protect or enhance their own self-image in this motive. To shield the victim from criticism, embarrassment, or anger, this form of deception is used. Finally, we shall look at the relationship-focused motive of deception. The manipulative individual will use this deception in the hope of limiting any harm that could come to the relationship simply by avoiding the trauma and conflict of relationships. This form of deception sometimes helps the relationship, depending on the situation, and at other times it may be the cause of harming the relationship because it will make things more complicated. For example, if you choose to hide how you feel about supper because you don't want to get into a fight, the relationship might be helpful. On the other hand, if you have an affair and choose to keep this information to yourself, it will only complicate things in the end. Primary components of deception As much as it may be a bit difficult to clarify which factors show clear deployment of deception, there are some subtle components that are immediate identifiers of these themes. The victim will come to be aware of these factors only when the manipulator dispatches a direct lie. Let us now dive deep into the particulars of said components. Disguise The first component we shall unravel is that of disguises. What usually goes on here is that the manipulator works tiredly up to until he successfully creates the impression of being someone that they are not. Manipulators often result in this tactic if they want to hide burry something about them so deep that no one ever finds out. This could be a dark secret, or just something as harmful as someone’s name. The popular belief of this component is that is simply a change of clothes just like in the moves, however it goes far beyond this in that it also involves a complete change of one's persona. Having a rough idea of how discuses work, let us look at a few examples of how it can be used in the process of deception. The first instance is where the manipulator changes himself to another person so as not to be discovered. This will be done by an individual with a view to maybe be able to get back into a particular crowd of people that are not very fond of him, revamp their whole personality so as to make someone like them or just to further their own personal goals.in some instances, disguise may be used to refer to the hiding of one’s true nature in the hopes of maybe hiding the effect that appears to be unpopular with that proposal. Disguises usually have adverse effects because it is generally the hiding of one’s true intentions for a particular victim. When information is withheld in this fashion, it often clouds the victim’s judgment. The victim ends up having the feeling of being in control of their decisions when in reality they have been swayed towards the manipulator's directions. This is seen mainly in a political setting. Camouflage This is where an individual works tirelessly in order to hide the truth in one way or another leaving his victim clueless as to what exactly is going on. This is characterized by the manipulator's use of half-truths when divulging certain information to his victim. The victim will only be aware that camouflage has taken place later when the actual truths are brought to light. A skilled manipulator with a lot of experience using camouflage is more likely to bra undetected in performing certain actions. Simulation The third component of deception is what is commonly referred to as simulation. This is simply the process where the victim is constantly being shown subject matter that is false in every way. Further on, we get to see that simulation consists of 3 other techniques that can be used. They are mimicry, distraction, and fabrication. Fabrication is the scenario where the manipulator takes something that is found in actual reality and chafes it to become this completely different thing. The manipulator will seek to either give detailed events of something that never happened or add some exaggerations that either make it sound better or worse than it actually sounds. The core of their story, however, is usually true. If the teacher gives them a bad grade, these manipulators may further the story by stating that they were given the bad results on purpose. The reality is that the manipulator did not study for the test hence his bad grade. Mimicry is another tool that manipulators use when deploying these tactics of deception. The manipulator here usually portrays a persona that it is quite close to their own, but not their own. They may present an idea that is similar to someone else’s, and give him credit for thinking about it first. This form of stimulation may be able to take pace through visual and auditory stimulus. The last tool we shall look at is that of distraction as another form of simulation in deception. This is where the manipulator tries to get the victim to only focus their attention on everything else but the truth. How is this usually done? This is usually achieved through baiting or the offering of something more tempting than the truth itself. The best example of this is that of a marriage situation. Where the husband is involved in extramarital affairs and thinks that the wife has caught a whiff of this, he may start graving her with random gifts such as designer clothes so as to distract her from thinking about his cheating.th one flaw to this is that it often tends not to last as long as intended. Detecting deception If you may be interested in looking for the rights defences against deception, then the first thing you would do is have a clear conscious that allows you to detect deception as its being deployed.it may be difficult in determining whether deception is occurring or not. This is of Corse unless the manipulator becomes a bit sloppy in his approach and levees sufficient breadcrumbs showing that he is indeed languor of grips contradiction of statements.as much as it may be difficult for a manipulator to deceive his victim for an extended period of time, it is something that we practice on those closest to us on a daily basis. What makes detection of deception a bit hard is that there are really no solid indicators that are 100% reliable to tell when deception has happened. Deception, however, is capable of placing a large burden on the manipulators cognitive functioning as they will have to figure out how to recall the agent's functioning as they will have to figure out how to recall all the statements they made to the subject in order to keep the story credible and consistent. One slips up and the subject can say something is wrong. Due to the strain of keeping the story straight, the agent is much more likely to leak information to tip the subject through either nonverbal or verbal indications. Over the course of time, researchers have given us sufficient reason to believe that detecting an attempt of deception is usually a process that is cognitive, fluid and complex. These processes are not usually constant as they will often vary depending on the message that is being relayed. The interpersonal deception theory describes deception to be an iterative and dynamic process of influence between the manipulator, whose sole purpose of this is working towards twisting information to a version that best suits them but is different from the truth, and the victim, who will then attempt to figure out if the message being relayed to them is of an accurate nature or quite the contrary. It is during this particular exchange that the victim is going to bring to light all the nonverbal and verbal information that will cue the victim in to the deceit.at some point in this process, the victim may be able to tell that they are being lied to by the manipulator. One of the few renowned scholars of this theme of deception by the name Alert Vrij, his view of the detection of deception. He was of the opinion that there were no known nonverbal behaviours that could be associated with solely with deception. This is one of the many reasons as to why it is not possible to tell when an individual is being deceptive. While there exist certain nonverbal behaviours that are associated with acts of deception, these same cues may also present themselves when other behaviours are present. This is what makes it difficult to determine whether or not a manipulator is using deception unless the utter a direct lie. Another scholar who weighed in on this enigmatic theme of detection was Mark Fank. He focused more on how deception can be detected at the victim’s cognitive level. When deception takes place, it usually requires a conscious behaviour that is mainly deliberate on the victim's side, so the listening to words and paying attention to the body language that is going on are both critical when trying to determine when someone is in the process of deceiving you. If for example a manipulative person asks a question which the victim doesn’t feel comfortable answering directly, you can tell that they are lying just from the manner in which he repeats words a lot, has very poor structure of logic and generally uses less time talking about that particular question. Basically, when attempting to figure out when deception occurs, there are not many signs that can be considered. There are however few nonverbal signs that may be present when someone deploys this tactic of deception, but they may have other issues like nervousness or shyness as well. CHAPTER TEN: THE DARK TRIAD What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the dark triad? Probably some fictional realm created by Hollywood, right? Well this is actually a key concept that ties together all aspects of dark psychology. The dark triad in a nutshell is the theme that houses the three most destructive and harmful psychological personality traits known to man.in the concurrent pages, well shall seek to bring these traits to light and Better understand them for adequate preparation against them.by the time we are done, you will realise that all other themes of dark psychology stem from this very theme. These traits are psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism. The majority of individuals by the mention of these very traits will have a stereotypic description of psychopath as a murderous person, and a narcissist as a human who is just obsessed with themselves. There is however much more to these antisocial disorders than just the stereotypes. Each of these concepts must be respected and understood for their power to become apparent. Machiavellianism This is a technique that traces its origins from the famous political philosopher known as Machiavelli. His established works on influence and political power, “the prince”, Machiavelli shares with the rest of the world his version of ideas, principles, and tactics that have saved the purpose of a sort of blueprint for those individuals who might be looking for influence throughout the course of history. Based on this, we then ask ourselves what this Machiavellian person actually is and how he comes about. What puts this particular tactic on the map is basically the manipulator's affinity to only focus on one's self-interest at all times, the exercise of ruthless power and cruelty, one's understanding of the importance of image and the perception and superficial appearance.in a nutshell, Machiavellian individuals are people whose approach to life is widely strategic. Meaning that, the ramifications and consequences that they take are usually well thought out and assessed in terms of how they might end up impacting their lives if they do it in a particular way .you may simply identify a Machiavellian individual since their speech often revolves around something like, “how will this benefit me, and how will my public reputation be impacted by this result?” Machiavellian individuals are pros at doing that which personally serves their interests while at the same time skilfully managing to maintain the best public image without anyone being the wiser. Perhaps one of the biggest examples of one such individual is that of the former president of the United States, bill Clinton. He succumbed to his sexual desires while in office time and time again, while at the same time managed to keep the people's admiration for him stronger than ever. This is really an advantage he had over majority of politicians with the same lifestyle but is frowned upon by the public. Another example in the political arena is also that of President Barrack Obama, and George W Bush. Barrack Obama while in office cultivated and capitalized on his love for peace while Bush solidified his image as that of a guy who always had war on his mind. Obama was able to manipulate the masses building a public perception that served his one interest evil bush did to even try. This is despite the very fact that both of these presidents were as militant as the next president. This is a very powerful lesson of what people perceive VS what the actual reality of things is. Psychopathy To be able to tell you in black and white what psychopathy really is would be difficult but the vary basic definition of what psychopathy really is ,or rather who a psychopath really is, is that particular individual who seems to be suffering from a type of psychological disorder which heavily involve a superficial charm, impulsivity and a lack of commonly held “human” emotions such as empathy and remorse .these psychopaths can be regarded as the most dangerous people on the face of the earth as they are the best examples of two faced sons of bitches. Pardon my language. When majority of people hear the mention of these individuals, the first image that usually comes to mind is of a haggard looking individual wielding a machete and wearing a mask like John Wayne Agency. But the reality of their identity is far from this. They are most likely to be very handsome strangers who win over their victims by being just the right amount of charming, before eventually ruining or even ending their victims lives. Surprisingly, based on a series of tests, experiments, and observations, it has been discovered that there exists a high number of these individuals at the very helm of the business world. A majority of people are just now beginning to view psychopathy as more of a problem to the whole society that for the very psychopaths owns selves. They are usually programmed in such a way that they can survive in any field they chose to go into. This is mainly attributed to their indifferent views they have regarding normal human feeling of love, compassion and so forth. Narcissism? If you ask anyone who they think a narcissus is, I can bet on it that the most likely answer you are likely to receive is that of an individual who simply loves themselves. This is along the correct lines but not accurate enough, particularly when narcissism is understood through the dark triad lens. Without being a narcissist, you can have self-love. So, what are some of the differences between a highly self-esteemed individual and someone who is narcissistic to the extent that they are regarded in the Dark Triad range? Someone who meets narcissism's medical diagnostic requirements, to the point that they are deemed to have a psychological disorder, is likely to continuously display a variety of the following characteristics. They are usually captives of the inflated sense of self-worth which manifests itself f in a number of ways .these include seeing their lives as the most special and important to have ever existed., seeing that they're of a biter spaces hire in status than that of “normal people”. This behaviour often reflects their sense of self-worth. Narcissists are likely to have an excessively inflated self-worth, such as seeing their life as special and one of the most important in history, often the most important. Narcissists are not, in their own minds, only special-they are superior. They are a better species of person, higher in status than “normal” people. Their behaviour reflects their sense of self-worth. Some of narcissism's prevalent outward manifestations are an inability in any manner to tolerate criticism or dissent. The need to be flattered is similar to this need to be agreed. Narcissists need continuous praise, endorsement, and appreciation and tend to organize their life in a manner that provides them continuous access to others who meet this need. Having looked at the base of this particular behemoth theme of dark psychology, let us now dive in headfirst into how the dark triad manifests itself into the behaviours of these indifferent human beings. Machiavellian characteristics What was discussed above, we know that a Machiavellian person is a political schemer who is mainly concerned border lining obsessed with his public image. These particular groups of individuals are considered to be the most cold-hearted in their pursuit of self-interest above all else. What then could be said about the behaviour of these types of individuals? Due to their master level skill of masking their true intentions from the public eye, their behaviours might be abetted hard to decipher. For most individuals who do not fulfil Machiavellianism's clinical definition, their public persona is generally a reflection of their true personal self. Everyone polishes their picture and conduct in public a little, but in general, the outward picture of most people is nothing more than a polished portrait of who they really are. They often have a fine line as to what they truly are and the person who they often pottery themselves to be in the public eye. Perhaps the best example to be given here is that of serial killers. The best has often been able to escape the grip of the law because of their outward image being the furthest thing from their morbid fascinations. The most famous example that can be given on this is that of renowned serial killer, Ted Bundy. He was a very handsome man according to those who knew him. He was also very eloquent and just wall presented that no one imagines him to have a single bad bone in his body. This is what enabled him to murder an upwards of 30 women before he was eventually caught. Examples of such a distinction between intent and appearance can be found in areas less extreme than serial murder. There are countless tales of leaders in the world of business who manage to ruthlessly cut jobs and pursue profit over people whenever possible. In terms of Machiavellianism, the very best of these bosses can actually get individuals to purchase into the idea that they behave by necessity or even compassion! Such rulers are almost role models for those who only want to serve their own wishes while simultaneously appearing to be a "person of the individuals." A willingness to exploit people is another hallmark of Machiavellian individuals. Let us look at an example to have a better understanding of this. A newcomer in a particular office who possesses these Machiavellian traits would see each individual colleague, boss or team member as a resource or piece of a puzzle to use and utilize. The Machiavellian person would see a sequence of strategic threats and weaknesses to handle, exploit, or neutralize instead of seeing others as fellow human beings. This is a big component of the reason why Machiavellians are so conscious of how they find themselves. They understand that this outward depiction is the key to exercising impact and exploiting everybody they come across effectively. Another characteristic of Machiavellian people is the instillation of fear in the people around them. This comes straight from "The Prince" which urges individuals to simultaneously be both feared and loved. If this is not feasible, then it is better to love the book states that are feared. At the same moment, this notion of the desirability of being loved and feared is directly related to the Machiavellian characteristic of dividing a public and private perception. In the very individuals who would truly pretend to feel greater love than fear as a consequence, the ideal Machiavellian can inspire fear and obedience. Psychopathic characteristics It is in all aspects to know how this group of individuals manifest themselves so as to detect them early and putting up the necessary defences against them. Charm is one of a psychopathic person's most prevalent behaviors. It must be understood that this charm is superficial rather than profound, real charm. If you think of a truly charming individual from your lifetime, you will probably acknowledge that they have favourable characteristics that underpin outward behavioural displays. However, if an n individual genuinely displays a charming persona as an expression of kindness, they should not be labelled as psychopaths. Psychopaths can show all the outward indications of charm such as physical appeal, obvious warmth, and interest in others. The inward motive behind these outward displays is why it's such a red flag. Psychopaths see charm as part of an equation. The manipulator usually asks himself as to whether if displaying a particular emotion towards the victim makes them feel in a particular euphoric way and also if the result will prove to be advantageous or themselves. They are very calculative people who are numb to normal human feelings. Lying is another trait that really makes psychopaths really stands out. We all lie in our day to day lives. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we are all psychopaths. However, it can show a psychopathic personality when coupled with other characteristics. Lying comes for a psychopath as naturally as breathing for most individuals who are psychologically healthy. A psychopath can convincingly present the reality in a specific time as anything they need it to be. Also, psychopaths do not demonstrate outward indications of lying because they do not have any emotional attachment or emotions of shame, guilt or excitement about their lies. Lying is just "doing what's required at the moment" for psychopaths. Another signature aspect of psychopathy is a lack of impulse control. Most individuals have processes and inner controls that stop them from acting rashly. These mechanisms of prevention are lacking for a psychopath. If a psychopath sees a chance they want to exploit, they will behave without hesitation or a second thought. This may require murdering someone they want to kill, violating someone they want to rape, or stealing something they want to steal. This cruel impulsiveness is what makes psychopaths in areas such as the army and company globe some of the most efficient individuals. Automatic adoption of decisive intervention is a feature that much non- psychopaths lack and this absence are, in fact, detrimental to life advancement. Another characteristic that distinguishes psychopaths from no psychopathic people is a lack of remorse. Many individuals who have committed atrocious acts, such as murder, feel a profound feeling of guilt and shame about what they have accomplished because of these emotions and even take their own lives. Psychopaths do not choose to be remorseful- they are physically unable to do so. Asking a psychopath to feel remorse is like asking to listen to music from a deaf individual. A lack of guilt is closely associated with a lack of remorse. Usually humans feel guilty when they break some kind of moral standard they value personally. Since psychopaths do not believe correctly or wrongly, only helpful or unnecessary, guilt is an alien notion for them. The nearest thing that a psychopath may convey to guilt or remorse is regret that they have not performed their psychopathic acts to their own high standards. Narcissistic characteristics One of the most prevalent characteristics in all almost all narcissists is the fantasies of their absolute power and elevated sense of importance. Most of these individuals lay blame to the constant praise they got as children while talking about these fantasies.as adults these individuals will still demand praise from all around hem since they have nurtured the feeling of being most important of their peers to the maximum. The inflated sense of self-worth experienced internally by narcissists also has consequences for their external reality. This typically manifests in two ways - the need for consent and praise, and criticism or rejection hate. For the narcissistic ego, praise and consensus are like oxygen, while criticism and dissent are like poison. Picture a dictator in a hermit state in order to comprehend what narcissism looks like when taken to its logical conclusion. Such individuals request worship from those over whom they have authority, statue building in their likeness, and full obedience and recognition. Any act of dissent or disagreement shall be punished quickly and brutally. North Korea would be an ideal contemporary illustration of narcissism's extreme manifestation. That nation's rulers request reverence like gods and execute and torture anyone who even dares to convey a thought or concept that is not entirely consistent with formal doctrine of the state. CHAPTER ELEVEN: MIND GAMES When a person plays “mind games” on us, it is attributed to being innocent. Many people have come across this at some point in their life. Take an example when someone is planning a surprise party and doesn’t want the other person to know and he does this by playing mind tricks in order not to give away what the surprise actually is. This is merely considered innocent and silly. Dark psychology mind games are not in any way innocent. Mind games in dark psychology are attributed to the hypnotist toying with the will power and sanity of his victim. This differs from other dark psychological manipulation in the sense that the manipulator is playing with his victim for his own pleasure and enjoyment and is not invested in what the outcome will be. His interest in the victim would be to test the victim so to speak. Mind games are used by a hypnotist when other forms of suggestions to the victim are not effective and may decide to use mind games which are rather less obvious to the audience. The manipulator may decide to use mind games to his own pleasure and amusement. Mind games are very effective in reducing the assuredness and psychological strength of the victim. The victim is eluded into thinking that he still has control. Manipulators are able to satisfy their twisted amusement when playing mind games. Such dark psychological manipulators do not see their victims as equal human beings and instead chooses to see the victim as a ‘toy’ and a person who can be manipulated and therefore, watch with amusement when victims do what they tell them to. Sometimes, a dark manipulator will have known mind games all his life and knows no other forms of dark psychology manipulation. These manipulators can be dangerous because they know not of any other option and therefore no need of changing and being more humane. Let us dive into the specific types of mind games used by dark manipulators. Ultimatum An ultimatum can be defined as a final proposition or condition. One, therefore, is presented with a severe choice. They are viewed more as demands other than a request. An example is, “Be more outgoing...or I will see other people”. Certain factors will decide whether an ultimatum will be considered as a mind game. The three factors are one, the type of person giving the ultimatum, second the intention for giving the ultimatum and lastly the nature of the ultimatum. Persons who give ultimatums and genuinely care about the persons and have a valid reason for doing so, and then it will fall under the non-dark manipulation. These persons will generally include spouses, parents, siblings or close relatives. However, if they fall into any of the categories mention it does not necessarily rid them of dark intentions from the ultimatum given. What was the intention of the person giving the ultimatum? People with good intentions are often driven by the desire to help or assist in bettering the life of a person. Where a person gives an ultimatum to for example stop smoking or drinking too much, then this seen as good intentions. Being able to tell the intention of an ultimatum is difficult and so looking at the nature of the ultimatum itself is the surest way to be able to tell whether it is dark. Dark manipulative ultimatums will involve the person doing something that goes against what they stand for and goes against what their self-interest. The victim ends up comprising their moral standards in the process. Manipulators test their victims to see how far they go in compromising what they believe in. As we have seen, non-dark ultimatums are usually to benefit another person and the does not have to go against what they know is wrong. What is a dark psychological ultimatum? The person giving the ultimatum will be a friend, a boss or a person who the victim is in a toxic relationship with. It could also the form of a spouse, a parent or a sibling. The manipulator will often give ultimatums that go against the victim’s moral conviction or that which can possibly be dangerous to the victim. Here, the dark manipulator will notice a disinclination towards something and take advantage of this to make their victim do their bidding. An example will be a girl who is not comfortable in wearing costumes or revealing clothes. Some of the ultimatums will be, “It’s an only costume party, it is either you wear one or you are not invited”. Some ultimatums lead to harm to others such as assault and even murder. At very extreme cases, the victim ends up taking his own life in completing a suicide pact in which the manipulator does not honour his end. The External Break up Everybody likes to be in a relationship where there is that sense of security and knowing that your partner is content. A manipulator will know this but will use these for their dark intentions. A manipulator will ensure that their partner will be powerless by instigating feelings of instability, and negativity within their relationship. This technique of ‘The External Break up’ is often deployed in a romantic relationship. It manifests itself when a partner continuously to scares the other that he or she will leave them. This is aimed at creating feelings of anxiety and instability within the relationship. This mind game takes the form of promised breakups, implied breakups and actual breakups that do not happen. Implied breakups are those that are not expressly stating the words ‘break up’. Instead, the manipulator throws hints there and then to create some doubt in the partner’s mind. They can do this by making statements that exclude their partner from future plans together. Promised breakups happen where the dark manipulator scares their partner that they instead to break up with them somewhere in the near future. Words like, “Don’t worry I won't have to deal with this anymore because I’ll be leaving soon” show the intention of a breakup in the future. Promise breakups fall in between the implied breakups and the actual breakups. Where the dark manipulator mentions the idea of cutting ties with their partner, either by divorcing, separating or breaking up, but does not follow through then it calls under the promised breakup. The actual break is the most severe compared to the implied and promised breakups. It happens when the manipulator decides to leave their victim without actually leaving in the end. They may pack up their clothes and belongings in the attempt to leave but once they see the sadness all over their victim’s face, the decide otherwise. After going through and understanding the tactic of the “external break up” we ask ourselves what therefore is the end game for manipulator when they use this tactic? The manipulator aims at having the upper hand in the relationship by creating feelings of uncertainty and lack of security from the life of the victim and therefore reducing their power in the hands of the manipulator. By repeatedly simulating a breakup with the victim, the manipulator is trying to test the waters of how far one will go in putting up with being treated like a toy. In the end, when the manipulator gives in to the victims’ begging for the relationship to continue, they make themselves look like the generous ones. This works so well for the manipulator because his or her victim is not thinking rationally to be able to figure out why they relationship should end. They are therefore willing to continues with the relationship. Many people do not understand this concept of dark psychology and why a person would want to continue to be in a relationship with a dark manipulator in the first place. The impact of this on the victim includes the likelihood of developing serious trust issues where they will have a hard time trusting another person. This could take a toll on the victim’s professional relationships and family relationships as well. After a long period of constant threats, the victims become almost like a slave to the manipulator in which the manipulator eventually grows tired and moves on to their next prey. Hard to get And just like ultimatums, the hard to get tactic can easily pass off as being normal. Hard to get can be dark as it can be also harmless and normal. Hard to get when it is harmless it occurs when a person will want to make them seem trying to be with them is not as easy. They will do this by making themselves less available by not making to every date and leaving the phone to ring a couple of time before finally picking up. The ‘hard to get’ dark psychology is much riskier. The manipulator will use this tactic during the relationship rather than at the beginning of the relationship. Unlike the innocent hard to get where the intention is to eventually be in a happy relationship, dark psychology hard is far from taking into account the wellbeing of the victim. When used at the beginning of the relationship it is innocent because no expectations are infringed at this point. At this point, no one is dependent or reliant on either of the person, so no harm comes from playing hard to get. Further along in a relationship when things are going on well then suddenly a person is unreliable and often times tries to make themselves busy. This kind of behaviour is not normal because relationships are about making and spending time with each other as this will firm up the relationship. A manipulator will be very cunning and start pulling away when their partner us already reliant on them. The victim will therefore put an extra effort to reconnect with their partner. In the end, the manipulator has the upper hand and will use this power to his or her own purpose while the victim is left in deep confusion and instability. CHAPTER TWELVE: HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF FROM PERSUASION AND MANIPULATION We are indeed human at the end of the day.it is because of this very reason that we get to dwell allot on the opinion of others in everything that we do. We always desire and adore getting validation from others so that we can subconsciously decide whether or not we shall be depressed.in this age of the millennial, the norm has become to just brag about their wealth on social media. A lot of these bragging are often than not the truth. This ultimately leads to one having a loose relationship with reality. Self-deception of this type can dig deep into the human spicy, that a victim of these may one day wake up and realise that their perfect world is only existent within their maids. Depression will closely follow suit. The first step to attempting to defend yourself from persuasion and manipulation is confronting the situation and taking the stance of breaking off any illusions you may have. You will not be able to proceed normally with your life. You have to be wary of the fact that you are in control of your own choices. Then make the conscious choice of seeing things for what they are. That deal, which seems too good to be true, could actually be just that... too good to be true. The other thing you should follow is to definitely trust your instincts. There are times that a lie has been told to you in the most skilled way imaginable, that you will end up believing. But you can feel an imbalance on some instinctive level between what should be, what is, and then what is being projected onto you. There may be no physical signs to show that hey, something is wrong, but you feel something is wrong. The next important thing when you ask questions is to listen to the responses. This may sound somewhat unbelievable because you'll listen to the answers. The truth is that our self-disappointment can make us choose the answers we receive. We tell ourselves that we listen, but we only pay attention to the answers we want to hear rather than to the answers we receive. You may have broken the illusions around you, but some of you are still clinging to the comfort of those illusions. The pain of confronting the situation would prevent you from listening to the real answers to your questions. Actual listening requires a certain sense of detachment, but this time around not from reality. You have to get rid of your emotions. Your detachment from our emotions would lead you to the next step, which would logically process the new information. It can complicate situations more than they already are to act irrationally. It makes your exit strategy so much difficult to let all the emotions simmer and spring to the surface. When you face the truth, the irrational part of you may want you to let it all go hell. Your rightly justified anger can inspire you to take steps to calm your emotions in the short term. But you may come to regret these actions in the long term. I’m not saying that you should deny your emotions; I'm not saying that you do not act on these emotions. First deal with the situations and later deal with your emotions. Act quickly It’s great that you have come to terms with the reality of things. But defence against these dark manipulative tactics entail so much more. While attempting to defend you from the claws of these manipulators, is often intense and exhilarating at first. This intensity of these emotions may cause one to slowly slide into denial. The more you delay in taking any action is usually what accelerates the onset of this denial, and when it happens, there are high chances that you might relapse and end up getting trapped in the same web. This can be avoided by taking action immediately you realise that someone is trying to manipulate you. This can present itself in the simplest of ways like when informing a close friend of some reality of the particular situation may be all that’s needed so set in motion a series of events that will eventually lead to your freedom. You should know that the fabric of illusion is made from tougher material than glass after making the choice to act. The illusion could work its way back into your heart with your emotions in high gear by using fragments of your emotions to fix it. When a liar is caught in a lie, he or she may attempt to recruit others to enforce that lie when they feel that they are no longer holding you. A deceptive partner with whom you have recently broken things off would at this point try to use the other mutual relationships in your life to change your mind. If you want to get out of this unscathed, you will need both your logic and instincts. Although the truth of the situation is that when you discover that you've been lied to consistently, you become emotionally scarred, so the issue of leaving the situation unscathed becomes silent. Priority should be given, however, to take the route that allows you to leave this toxic situation without harming yourself further. You’re all over the place emotionally. Rage, anger, hurt, and deception is the iceberg's tip. But logically, you need to think. Keep your head above the water and warn yourself. Get help fast When you're trapped by other people's manipulations, confusion is one of the emotions you'd experience. This helps cloud your rational thinking and leaves you feeling helpless. You might even question the reality of what you are facing at this point. It would lead to denial if you continue to entertain these doubts. You’re probably going to want to conclude you've got the whole situation wrong. That you misunderstood some things and came to the wrong conclusion. Such thinking would drive back to the manipulator's arms. Resist the urge to give in by receiving a second opinion. People go to another doctor in a health crisis to get a second opinion. This is to remove any iota of doubt about the first diagnosis that you may have and to affirm the best treatment course for you. Similarly, getting another person's opinion can help you discern the truth of the situation and what might be your next steps. Just remember, it's better to go to someone who has proved countless times they're interested in your best. The next step is to confront the perpetrator if you have the help you need. For this, I suggest you choose the scene or location. Choose a place you know that gives you the upper hand. On your part, that would require some careful planning. If the perpetrator exists in the cyber world, especially if the person swindled you of your money, you would have to involve the police and the relevant authorities. Do some of your own investigations so as to ascertain the truth. After you face the perpetrator and take the necessary steps to get out of the situation, you must start the healing process quickly. The scale and gravity to which you were hurt, manipulated or abused do not matter. You must be able to walk past it and wait until you can "heal" your wounds, rather than sitting on your couch and reliving the past. Time would give you enough distance from your experience, but if you learned something from this book, it would be almost never healing for emotional scars. If you don't do anything about it, an unhealthy scab could form over the wound, which would make you as vulnerable if not more than you had experienced. Speak to a counsellor, attend therapy, and take an active part in facilitating the healing process, whatever you choose to do. It won't happen overnight, but you are sure that you get closer to improving every day and every step you take in therapy. Trust your instincts While your brain interprets signals based on facts, logic, and sometimes experience, your heart works in the opposite direction by screening information through an emotional filter. The only thing that picks up vibrations is your gut instinct, which neither the heart nor the brain can pick on. And if you can groom to the point where you recognize your inner voice and are trained to react to it, you will lower your chances of being seduced by people trying to work on you with their manipulative will. To begin with, it's hard to recognize this voice. And that's because we allowed voices of doubt, self-discrimination as well as the critics ' loud voices within and without drowning out our authentic voice over the course of our lives. Your survival depends on this voice or instinct. So, trust that when it kicks in, your brain neurons can still process things in your immediate vicinity. Some people call it intuition, and some refer to it as instinct, especially when it comes to relationships, they are undoubtedly the same thing. You must accept that it may not always make logical sense to start trusting your instincts. If you've ever been in the middle of doing something and experienced the feeling of being watched all of a sudden, then you know what I mean. You don't have eyes at the back of your head, there's no one else with you in the room, but you get the tiny shiver running down your spine and the "sudden knowledge" you're watching. That’s what I'm talking about. The first step to connect with your instinct is to decode your mind with the voices you've let in. With meditation, you can do this. Forget the chatter of "he said, she said." Concentrate on your centre. You are the voice you know. Next, be careful about your thoughts. Don’t just throw away the eclectic monologs in your head. Rather go with the thoughts flow. Why do you think of a certain person in some way? How do you feel so deeply about this person, even if you only knew each other for a few days? What’s that nagging feeling about this other person that you have? You get more tuned to your intuition as you explore your thoughts and understand when your instincts kick and how to react to it. You may need to learn to take a step back to pause and think if you are the kind of person who prefers to make spur decisions at the moment. This moment in which you pause gives you the opportunity to really reflect on your decisions and evaluate them. The next part is a hard part and it couldn't be followed by many people. Unfortunately, you can't skip or navigate around this step. This part has to do with trust. You need to be open to the idea of trusting yourself and trusting others to be able to trust your instinct. Your failure to trust others would just make you paranoid, and it's not your instincts that kick when you're paranoid. It's the fear of you. Fear tends to turn every molehill into a hill. You must let go of your fear, embrace confidence, and let that lead in your new relationships. You are better able to hear the voice inside without the roadblocks put up by fear in your mind. Finally, your priorities need to be re-evaluated. If your mind is at the forefront of money and material possessions, you may not be able to see the past. Any interaction you have with people would be interpreted as people trying to take advantage of you, and if you dwell on that frequently enough, it will soon become your reality. You know how you attract into your life what you think of. If you're constantly thinking about material wealth, you're only going to attract people who think like you. Using this as a guide, look at all your relationships with this new hindsight; the old, the new, and the perspective. Don’t enter a relationship that expects to be played. Be open when you approach them, whether it's a business relationship, a romantic relationship or even a regular acquaintance. You can get the right feedback about them from your intuition. Do not step into this thinking, too, that your gut will tell you to run in the opposite direction when you meet suspect people. CONCLUSION Hypnosis is a psychological state when an individual loses his or her will to do things willingly, thus subscribing to a hypnotist's orders. We've found that hypnosis is actually true and not stories or films we saw on television. It can either be verbally or nonverbally suggested in two types. The tactics of a manipulator can take the form of verbal or non-verbal suggestions. Compared to nonverbal, verbal recommendations are more difficult because the words used by the hypnotist could be innocent and familiar. An instance is the hypnotizer who wanted to cause suicidal thought by wrapping it up in phrases like,' You will go to an art gallery to enjoy art and death.' Silent indications can be used by a hypnotist. This is accomplished by the language of the body, including the posture of the body, facial expressions and gestures and the hypnotics. There are individuals who are more inclined to follow the suggestions of the hypnotist. Vulnerability to hypnotism can be triggered lately by some life-changing accounts. The NLP technology includes individuals with the authority to manipulate individuals. Anchoring is a form of NLP technique that uses external stimuli and links hypnotisms to a certain emotional state and, finally, the technique of future pace that includes the hypnotic person taking a victim to an appalling place, his future. We distinguish persuasion from dark persuasion and try to alter how an individual believes. Persuasion can be positive, such as that of a police officer who tries to speak to an individual holding a weapon. Positive persuasion seeks to save an individual. Then there is a dark conviction, which has no moral foundation. In comparison, the process of doing an activity that harms the individual is defined as dark persuasion. Positive conviction leads to the convinced advantage and benefits for the persuader too. It ends in some beneficial action overall. Dark persuasion always helps the persuader, and the persuaded ends up doing something that harms him and harms third parties in certain cases, as well as A dark persuader is often a narcissist or a sociopath. Tactics used include a dark persuader who friends and trusts his victim. In this way, they wouldn't see (the lengthy con) coming, the convincer would take measures gradually with the victim the Dark Persuader is a specialist at (gradually) and the dark persuader would disguise his real motives from their victims by providing two applications in a row and using reserve psychology (masking real motives). Control of the mind may go undetected and this type is deadly. This makes it difficult for anyone under this control to object in any manner. Undetected mind controllers are not often as dark and often cowardly manipulators. Only after much consideration do you do so. The methods used by unrecognized mind control devices are to choose someone who wants to be their victim because he or she is more prone to unrecognized mind control. In this case the dark persuader discovers what the victim needs and takes advantage of it. Another is the restrictive selection method that requires the dark persuader to take away anything that a person has in relation to a case while making sure that the person thinks that he has controlled all the time. Media mind control (sound) is the art of sound, which controls an excellent instance of a person's mind, music in a restaurant that prompts clients to order wine from that nation and finally to manipulate an individual with pictures. The control of the mind becomes an obsession or a real interest, at least. It will be one of those things you want to constantly test and master. Not as important as before. Once you begin to "think a level," you will rise above the turbulence, compulsions, and desires that have first encouraged you to know how to control the thoughts and actions of others. The result: a calmness that puts things in a clear perspective. Your initial obsession with mind and power will be discovered, and your next desire will be to see how skilfully you can practice this strength. In the end, as you are surrounded by the tranquillity that real energy brings, your goal is to see how little effort is required to achieve what you want. Power is a tool, nothing more. The true persuaders of our behavior, as we try and try to raise ourselves above them, will remain our fears, vanities, and appetites. Believing anything else embraces Pollyanna's simplicity and denies our origins as livestock. People attribute too playful and stupid' mind games' like attempting to surprise somebody, without giving away what the surprise really is. In the dark globe of psychology, mind games are not near to innocent, like teasing. A mind game in dark psychology connotes the manipulator's drive to play with the health and the victim's strength. The manipulator plays with health and wants his victim's authority for his own pleasure and pleasure. Specific kinds of intellectual games include ultimatums which reflect a requirement. Whether an ultimatum constitutes psychology relies on the purpose of the ultimatum, the individual who gives the ultimatum and the ultimatum nature. The internal rupture is another mind-game strategy used by manipulators, which takes the form of threats that end a connection. It is used in a romantic environment and creates fear. The difficult to understand the mental game of dark psychology should not be confused with the ordinary game difficult to come to where the female wants the effort to be worth it in most times. Dark difficult to get uses when a couple has had a relationship and often happens when the handler begins to pull, so his or her partner makes more efforts to save what he or she believes is a failed relationship. There is, unfortunately, no certain way to know what another person thinks, and the best thing a person can do is try to take control and understand their thoughts and remain true to what they trust because the heart of the man hides his true purposes. It is true that we have the ability to do excellent evil, but also the ability to do excellent good. There may have been someone who has betrayed you in the past, it may have been your best friend, friend or even family, but that doesn't mean you have to obsess it and stick to the past. Dark NLP: The Art of Reading People. How to Analyze People, Spot Covert Emotional Manipulation, Detect Deception and Defend Yourself from Toxic People Who Know NLP Dark Psychology Introduction Welcome to the world of dark psychology. While it may be scary to delve into at first, this is your ultimate manual for safe passage from beginning to end. You may be wondering what, exactly, “dark” psychology is... and is it as menacing as it sounds? The short answer is “sometimes”. Of course, we’ll delve into the specifics later on! For now, understand that it refers to our predisposition to manipulate and prey on others. It’s important to understand the reasoning behind criminal minds and how you can protect yourself from these master manipulators. Mind control, coercion, and manipulation are three of the key ingredients in cooking up dark psychological schemes. Criminology is deeply related to it because of this. If you’re interested in true crime you’ve landed upon the right book. Have you ever heard of “The Dark Triad”? It’s central to the theme of dark psychology. This refers to the three worst traits to see in a person: Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and Psychopathy. Each has a crucial role to play in understanding the mechanisms of dark psychology, who uses these methods, and how they affect your everyday life. Luckily, this book is a guide on how to protect yourself from the darker elements of the human nature. You’re going to learn exactly how these brains are formed, what to watch out for, and how to analyze situations as they arise. The world is a scary place, it’s true, but with the right tools you can navigate even the most troubled waters with the assurance of safety. Let this book be a guide for you through each challenge that lay ahead. People around the world have been practicing the science of Psychology for, basically, ever. Understanding the human mind and what makes it tick is no easy task. Over the course of time the thoughts and ideas in the world of Psychology have changed drastically. Many people rely on Psychologists to help them understand their behavior. In addition, they rely on them to help them figure out ways to deal with the problems of the world that weigh them down. Most people know that there are many types of Psychologists. You may have even spent some time with one in the past to work on your family, marriage, daily struggles, or issues that are much more sinister in nature. Psychology is not an exact science and what will work for some will not work for others. It is an ever-evolving science that can be very difficult to understand. Chapter 1: What is NLP? Dark Psychology is not standard Psychology. It specifically deals with individuals who thrive on taking advantage of others. It looks at the parts of our brains that are wired to do bad or misleading things. We all have our own capacities to do “evil”. However, some people are much more dangerous due to a lack of empathy, remorse, and a strong will to control everything around them. Learning what makes these people behave the way they do can help us all to be safer in the future. Dark Psychology is working on doing exactly that, understanding. Now, you are probably thinking about rapists and serial killers at this point and you aren’t wrong. These types of people certainly give into their dark tendencies, however, there is actually something far worse. The people that are less obvious about what they are doing are exponentially more dangerous. They make calculated moves and don’t act or look as if they would harm a fly. They are charming, witty, and oftentimes loved by those around them. Having the ability to see the traits and understand them through things like Dark Psychology is a benefit to everyone. When trying to truly understand dark psychology we need to start with understanding NLP. NLP stands for Neuro-Linguistic Programming. NLP has been part of the world since the 1970’s. We see it in our daily lives, however, most people don’t even know it is happening. It is especially prominent in marketing, pyramid schemes, and other scams throughout the course of its time. NLP is like a kid glove compared to the hard ways of typical hypnotherapy. It relies on subtlety and manipulation. Think of it as a suggestion that you just can’t seem to get out of your head until you are doing the thing you are thinking about. We will look at NLP in more detail in the next chapter. The Dark Triad Another area of importance in the world of psychology, is the Dark Triad. The Dark Triad is a set of three particular personality traits that are associated with some not so great things. As noted, they are Psychopathy, Narcissism, and Machiavellianism. Each of these traits have their own set of characteristics. Let’s take a minute and look at each one to gain a better understanding of why they are considered dark. We have all met people in our lives that are narcissistic or that others refer to as narcissists. A person who has the traits of Narcissism is one that thinks a lot of themselves. It is not always thinking you are the most beautiful one in the room, however, many narcissists do find themselves to be insanely attractive. Narcissists are also, commonly, people who have giant egos. They have a totally unrealistic view on their personal image. Obviously, people that are too full of themselves are difficult to be around and tend to be great at manipulation people and situations. Pretty easy to see why this is a character trait that we, non-narcissist, are happy to not have. Psychopathy has its own traits and they are much different than that of the Narcissist. Psychopathy is characterized by exceptionally anti-social behaviors. The psychopath does not, typically, feel empathy toward others. In addition, they can have big egos and no remorse for their actions in life. Unlike sociopaths who tend to come unhinged easily, Psychopaths are calculated and oftentimes very charming. This makes them dangerous. Machiavellianism, or “High Mech”, is the master of all manipulators. They don’t choose to be that way, they simply are that way. This type of person will go to extremes to gain power. Lying, cheating, stealing, and treachery are nothing to them. If the choice is between doing something moral to eventually meet your goals or stepping on and deceiving people to achieve goals more quickly, they will choose the latter every time. High Mech’s are calculating. They can be charming, but they will also use guilt and pressure to get what they want. When it comes down to it people that are part of the Dark Triad will do just about anything in their power to get what they want. You can easily see why this is dangerous and detrimental to the people around them. Having the ability to recognize these traits in people can help to keep you protected from their poison. It’s crazy to think how difficult it would be to deal with someone with only one of these issues. If you are around, in love, or working with one that falls into all three categories it can cause serious damage to your mental health. Hopefully, with more understanding those of you that deal with this type of behavior will be better prepared. Dark Psychology and Criminology Dark Psychology and Psychology play major roles in the world of Criminology. When you are trying to catch a criminal, it is easier if you understand how they think. Therefore, it is easy to see why these three things go hand in hand. Getting into the mind of a criminal, killer, or rapist can be very difficult for those of us that do not have these extremely dark tendencies. So, the fact that there is information accumulating for us to research is critical. It is hard to wrap your brain around how a human being can be wired so much differently. Until we find the ability to do this, it can make catching the really bad guys difficult. With advances in understanding the darker tendencies of human nature it has become easier for Criminologists, Police Officers, and others to find these ugly individuals. Psychology, and in turn, Dark Psychology have been around for a very long time. In fact, as far back as histories go, there have been people working on understanding why humans do what they do. We all have the capability of doing bad things. Some of us have a much easier time doing these non-moral acts above others. Finding examples of people from the past to present day that have the qualities studied in Dark Psychology is easy. It doesn’t matter what time frame you look at you will be able to pick out the characteristics easily with a few, obvious examples. Once you see it on a large scale you can start to look at the people around you everyday and see some of the same features. It is actually quite unsettling to realize how many people around you are prone to dark desires. One of the most obvious examples is Adolf Hitler. Obviously, he committed awful acts. However, he had more than an entire country under his thumb. Why is that? Well, he was charismatic, he spoke articulately, and he was an amazing manipulator. He completely understood what he needed to do to have control over the masses. He built a core group of like-minded people to help him along the way. While these people had a better look at what the truth was behind his tactics, we can’t believe they knew everything. A person such as Adolf Hitler would never let all of their secrets out. When looking for a prime example of a person that falls into all three categories of the Dark Triad, he is perfect. With fear, power, charisma, likability, and laser focus he managed to convince his people to commit atrocious acts against humanity. It’s odd to think that on an individual level, his followers were normal good people. When bombarded with propaganda, well-thought out words, and intimidation they bent to the will of a madman. If people were better able to understand what was driving Hitler, there could have been a stop to his reign much more quickly. With more information in Dark Psychology, pinpointing the traits of a person like Hitler is easier than ever. Another great example of a person that truly tapped into their dark nature was, cult leader, James Warren Jones. More commonly referred to as Jim Jones. Many people are familiar with the phrase “drinking the Kool Aid” and we have him to thank for that. He ran a cult that consisted of around 900 people. They all, literally, worshiped him. His cult was called The People’s Temple. He made promises of a Utopia for all of his followers. He relied on his charismatic attitude, well-spoken words, manipulation, and deceit to rope a large group of people to his calling. From the outside, he appeared to be doing and saying things for all the right reasons. He was vocal about issues like racial integration and homelessness. He truly looked like a man of god with good intentions. This was heinously inaccurate. He was after power and control at any means necessary. Once he had amassed a serious following, he relocated everyone to Guyana. Here, he started to rule his cult a bit differently. Instead of appearing like someone who was doing righteous acts he started to manipulate his followers in a more obviously dark way. He would use threats of physical violence, blackmail, and even death to control the people that were following him. Most people are pretty familiar with how this story ends. Upon worrying that the authorities were going to become involved with what was going on in Jonestown, he coerced his following to drink arsenic clad punch. His dark nature prevailed, and they did indeed drink the Kool Aid, which resulted in 900 deaths that included men, women, and children. One last great example of a person pursuing nothing but power is seen in Delphine LaLaurie. Some people have probably never heard of this woman and many wish that they had not. When you are looking for someone that seeks total control over people and takes pleasure in their pain, she is the person you should look toward. Born as Marie Delphine Macarty, this southern socialite married a few different men in the course of her life. Eventually, she was simply known as Madam LaLaurie. She maintained a great standing with the people of New Orleans. She was very in touch with everything that was going on and people held her in seriously high-regard. Little did they know something much more sinister was going on behind the scenes. LaLaurie owned more slaves than most other people and she loved to torture them. With little to no reasoning she would perform awful acts against them to show true dominance. Oftentimes, it led to months of torture for these poor souls, just to be ended in death. What LaLaurie looked like to the common public and what she really was were two completely different things. Chapter 2: Dark Psychology Wearing two faces is not uncommon for people that fall into the Dark Triad. It has been seen in many of the Dark Psychology theories that this is common. Someone that is pretending to be something else so that they can gain respect, power, and control is someone you don’t want on your team. You need to be careful when dealing with people you don’t know and understand that there are red flags to help you avoid becoming close with this type of toxic persona. Keeping yourself well-protected from people like Adolf Hitler and Jim Jones is critical. These are, of course, extreme cases. Many people have individuals around them or very close to them with traits that are very similar to these two men. The ability to recognize them can help improve your mental health, as well as, your safety. How to Analyze People The ability to analyze the people around you can help you determine their true motives. It can be very difficult to read people and, let’s face it, some people are excellent at coving up the truth. Nefarious plots and schemes can be seen in your everyday life. Whether you are at work, at home, or out with friends we are sure you deal with people constantly who are trying to manipulate you in one way or another. Putting time into understanding Dark Psychology can make seeing these truths about people and their intent infinitely easier. It truly does play a critical role in your ability to lead your best life. Staying protected from people that have dark tendencies is important, especially in your work life. We have all had a job at one time or another that was ruled by drill sergeants. Those people that believe you build a team through fear and intimidation. Conversely, you may have had a manager that treated everyone well but realistically relied on covert scare tactics and manipulation to hold on to power and control. Typically, we see more of these types of tendencies in upper management. People that focus solely on being the boss are, oftentimes, more apt to succumb to the dark pieces of human nature. They are willing to do some deplorable things to gain power, such as using intimidation tactics. Why would they work hard and fair to gain power when they can simply lie, manipulate, and deceive people to get what they want quickly? You may have also experienced the co-worker that is never happy with other people’s success. The person that starts to spared rumors about you simply because you are doing well. They try to turn people, including management, against you so that you will fall and they will succeed. Sometimes the way these people behave is very petty. Using small verbal digs to make you feel inferior. This can throw you off of your work game and ultimately lead to a loss of your job in more extreme cases. Employees that are arrogant, quick to anger, condescending, or domineering can truly rip a team apart. Being assertive and nipping their annoying and detrimental behaviors in the bud can help to ensure your team stays focused and cohesive. You can also work on being aware of people’s body language and use empathy to ease a troubling situation. Managing your own emotions can also help you keep a cool head and ward off any unnecessary tendencies before they become a problem. In addition, being in control of yourself can help you observe the actions that are happening around you as it is easier to have a broader perspective. Mastering these techniques takes time but can save you a lot of drama in your workplace. When you have the ability to pick out the traits of these type of people it can help you deal with the repercussion. Instead of feeling weak and vulnerable you will feel empowered. No longer allowing people to make you feel small or cause detriment to your career is quite freeing. Keep in mind that dealing with people that succumb to our darker sides can be very difficult. It is truly important when learning about traits like cheating, manipulation, lying, and selfishness that we look in the mirror. Self-actualization is an important factor of living your best life and being a good person. So, looking at your habits and pinpointing the ones that are detrimental to those around you is important. Even more importantly is figuring out how to change them so that you can evolve into something better. Finding the flaws in ourselves can be difficult. Broadening your perspective so you can see the things you do is even harder. With time and effort, however, you can truly work on these negative internal aspects to improve yourself. This is not only good for you but also for the people you come into contact with on a daily basis. Having bad habits is part of life. Sometimes these habits are simply annoying, like chewing with your mouth open. Other times, it is devastating to our lives. A good example of this is telling lies to spare feelings or to stop yourself from some sort of trouble. Other excellent examples are doing things like flattering people to get your way and being extremely cynical of other people’s thoughts or beliefs. Having the realization that you are doing these things does not come easy for many people. It can take a lot of hard work and dedication to truly find the ability to improve the way that you act and change your bad habits. There are a variety of ways that people have implemented to help aid them in finding their true self and dealing with their less than stellar qualities. Meditation One option that people find to be truly helpful is participating in Meditation practices. Meditation teaches mindfulness. It helps us to become aware of the things that we experience externally and internally. When you can become aware of your surroundings it helps encourage you to become aware of yourself. Meditation helps to quiet the mind. It brings peace and clarity to the people that practice it on a daily basis. It can be a difficult skill to accomplish in the beginning, as clearing your mind is hard all in itself. However, if you keep at it and delve into the numerous available pieces of information, learning how to meditate can be truly beneficial. People tend to not only lie to others but also to themselves. This can be very small lies or major ones. A benefit to Meditation is that it will allow you to focus on the negative aspects of yourself one piece at a time. This is due to the fact that self-actualization becomes easier as you become better at meditation. While many people believe that meditation is a hooky way of coping with bad behaviors it has proven itself effective time and again. Anyone can tell you that clearing your mind and focusing on yourself works. Until you do it for yourself, you will never be able to see the true power to overcome that it gives so many individuals. For many of us, studying oneself to become better is a major part of our lives, for others, not so much. People that fall into one or more of the Dark Triad groups, typically, have no wishes to become better. They don’t see anything wrong with their behavior or the way that they effect people. It is not surprising to find out that many of the people in these groups are criminals. As noted, there are three categories in the Dark Triad and it is clear to see why the behaviors of the people that fit into them are not good for anyone. It is important to understand that Psychopathy, Narcissism, and Machiavellianism have similarities but are also quite different. While it may seem that if you fit into one you could not fit into the others, however, this is simply untrue. There are absolutely people in the world that hold traits from all three categories and that can be catastrophic for the people around them. Over the years, measuring people's tendency towards darkness and bad behavior has changed. It used to be that Psychologists would simply look over individual types of personalities. Roughly twenty-years ago a new system was put into place. Dr. Peter Jonason and Psychology Professor, Gregory Webster put together a series of 12 questions to help determine if people fall into any of the categories of the Dark Triad. They developed this “test” in 2010 and it is still widely used today. Basically, it is a scale to figure out how malevolent you are. If you were to participate in this series of questions, you may be surprised at your own responses. It can help give you an idea of what you may need to work on to become a better person. You will find a better sense of self by looking over how you act with other people. As noted, there are twelve different statements that you will rate yourself against. It asks that you respond to statements like, “I flatter people to get what I want out of them”, and “There is nothing wrong with manipulating people for my own gain”. With these types of statements it is easy to piece together how people react to situations and whether or not they are wired towards the darkness or the light. People that fit easily into one or more of the Dark Triad tend to be quite anti- social. This is especially true of the Psychopath, however, it could be seen in any of the three categories. When someone excludes themselves from others it becomes easier for them to lose empathy and emotion. The differences in right and wrong can become more and more difficult to see when you seclude yourself. Anti-social behaviors are one of the key signs to the fact that someone may be struggling with the negative behaviors we see. It can lead to dramatic outbursts. In addition, the few people they do keep around can be in serious trouble. When a person doesn’t know how to interact or chooses not to it will impact every part of their life. When that same person is prone to violence, manipulation, deceit, or exploitation the negative impact on those around them is devastating. Criminals are, typically, anti-social in their behavior. It is seen throughout history and it’s sure to be seen in the future. People that are inclined to commit crimes almost always have traits that put them into one of the Dark Triad categories. Due to this fact, understanding each category is critical in developing solid strategies to track down and stop criminals. A large piece of what has allowed law enforcement and other organizations to track down these dark presences is Dark Psychology. Knowledge is power and when we can identify what things like body language and verbiage mean, tracking down criminals can become easier. The connection between criminal desires and the Dark Triad are clear to see and with the institution of Dark Psychology it can be easier to deal with. Dark Psychology, the understanding of malicious people, is a good thing for everyone to understand. While the big baddies of the world certainly fall into the Dark Triad, so do many other, much more common people. Not every person will become an Adolf Hitler, Jim Jones, or Charles Manson but they can make your life increasingly unattractive. In addition, they can cause serious mental and sometimes physical harm to you and the people you care about. Deciding to spend the time to learn how to recognize these behaviors and how to handle them is advantageous to every person in the world. Regardless of your lot in life, taking a good hard look at the people around you can help you uncover their true intentions. While we would like to say everyone in your life is there for a positive reason, it is very unlikely that it is actually true. Chapter 3: NLP and You Neuro-Linguistic Programming is used today for a variety of different things. It can be helpful in helping people overcome issues like anxiety, PTSD, and fears. These are only a very few issues that Neuron-Linguistic Programming can help with. While some people use it for good, others use it for darker desires. We would love to say that the only place you will find NLP is in your therapist’s office, however, we actually see it in everyday life. From your workplace to the ads on your social media accounts, you can actually see it everywhere. NLP does not only focus on what people say but more importantly focus on what people are doing. Our body language says more than our mouths ever could. NLP has been under the debate of whether it is an actual science or if it is considered a pseudoscience. The debate still exists today and it is hard to pinpoint this science due to the fact that it has not gone through the same rigorous testing as therapies such as CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. There is a pretty broad range of techniques used within NLP and this also makes it difficult to lock down which pieces actually work. There have been some studies performed and oftentimes the results were inconclusive. In some it appears as if NLP had made a true improvement in subjects with psychosis, instability, and other unwanted traits. Others, worked on looking at its effectiveness to help issues like PTSD and anxiety. The results came back exceptionally varied. Neuro-Linguistic Programming has been around for more than forty years. For something to be around this long and continue to be used throughout many people’s daily lives means there has got to be some validity to it, right? We see it used so widely on a commercial level and it certainly does have an impact. It also has its place in the world of Psychology and Dark Psychology. Due to the fact that it is quite unstructured it is difficult to show true proof of its success. There are also a plethora of different idea and ways of executing NLP. For some, it is a very effective form of therapy that truly helps them lead better lives. For others, it may not benefit them at all. These people will need to look at more traditional therapies to work through their issues and lead a happier and mentally healthier life. NLP History NLP is, in a way, a method of mind control. It was developed by a team of people. However, the majority of the credit is given to, two California boys, John Grinder and Richard Bandler. In the 1970’s, they decided to combine the works of Virginia Satir, a therapist for families, Freidrich Perls, a psychotherapist, and a hypnotherapist by the name of Milton Erickson. They wanted to take the heart of linguistic therapy and improve it. Find the pieces that truly worked and make something better. The three people that they studied were chosen due to the fact that they had better results with their clients than most others in their field. In fact, people found their success to be odd and uncommon. Naturally, inquisitive minds wanted to know what these people had in common and why their methods worked so well. They studied them in live sessions and via video tape. NLP is subtle. When we think about normal hypnotherapy, we think about people falling asleep and acting out strange and silly acts. Realistically, it is used for much more meaningful purposes. For example, people use hypnotherapy to help them stop smoking or to deal with traumas of the past that may have not been coped with. NLP does things a bit differently. It is much more suggestive and not so in your face. In the beginning, Neuro-Linguistic Programming was thought to be as helpful as products like “snake juice” from the days of the old west. However, as the seventies turned into the eighties it became more and more accepted. Businesses were jumping on the bandwagon to learn about it so they could, in turn, use it to help them gain profits from consumers. In addition, everyone from therapists to political figures started to want the information on this type of “programming”. It seriously started to blow up in terms of popularity. Companies became interested in NLP because it can help them communicate more clearly. This helps to improve the performance of employees and the overall performance of the business. Businesses that use NLP have experienced better growth in their companies as a whole. Not only can it help people become better negotiators it can also help them stay motivated. When you feel comfortable at work and you feel like everyone is giving it their all, it’s easy to build a solid team. Being a confident leader that pays attention to tone, body language, and verbiage will help lead to better success. Implementing the practices of NLP can promote growth for companies. As people started to employ these tactics, they started to notice changes in their teams. Boosts in morale and productivity. Now we see NLP happening around us every day. This is not necessarily a bad thing as people that practice NLP tend to be more self-aware. In turn, they tend to make better choices that are made from rationality rather than emotions. There are four main points to NLP, they are referred to as the Pillars of NLP. They are Behavioral Flexibility, Rapport, Outcome Thinking, and Sensory Awareness. Each one is of equal importance as the others. Taking the time to look briefly at each one of these points gives a better understanding of NPL as a whole and how it can help you weed out the fakers in your life. The first pillar we are going to look at is Behavioral Flexibility. Basically, this means to go with the flow. When people can see that the tactic they are currently using isn’t working and adapt their behavior it can have great results. Being able to quickly change your perspective will allow more people to understand you. The next aspect we are going to look at is Rapport. Creating a good rapport with someone is simply getting them to trust you quickly. In addition, it is the ability to form quick relationships with people. It is easy to build rapport by using common language, being polite, and showing empathy. There are many ways to build a good rapport with a person, these are only a few. Then we move on to Outcome Thinking. It is exactly what it states, spending the time to think about the end result of what you want. Oftentimes, people get stuck on a certain point, that is commonly negative. It consumes the thought pattern and can make choosing the correct route to where you actually want to go difficult. With outcome thinking you are always working toward an end goal. This can promote better decision making along the way. Lastly, we have Sensory Awareness. Being aware of your surroundings plays a major role in knowing what is actually going on. When you walk into a public place and you take notice of the tone of the room, the colors surrounding you, the groups of people, it can be very enlightening. It can also help you easily understand how you need to behave in that situation. The more you learn about these four pillars the more success you will have with NLP. They are the foundation and anyone who wants to learn NLP will spend a lot of time on each one. The more you broaden your knowledge the more you will be able to apply what you have learned to your daily life and the more protected you will be from the ones that want to manipulate you, control you, or cause other burdens in your life. NLP has grown and changed over the years. What started out as focusing on what people’s eyes were doing, the words they choose to use, and building quick rapport, turned into something much, much more. All sciences grow and change over the course of time and we imagine that this one will also continue to evolve. After focusing on what the yes were doing, word choice, and rapport this therapy started to grow and focus on other aspects. In the 80’s, the people using NLP were focusing on what it is that causes feelings inside of us. This helped therapists to figure out how to help someone deal with their individual problems. More and more people started using the techniques found with NPL but they wanted to put different names to it. To say they had come up with it all on their own. When it comes down to it, no matter what you call it, NPL is the same across the globe. Today, it is used not only to help you have control and choices in how you react, but it can also help you figure out what other people are up to. The people in the here and now that are using NPL have a variety of different reasons for doing it. Some of it is to help themselves become better people while for others it is about weeding out the rats in their lives. Businesses use it in team building and marketing techniques. Here again, we can see how vast the world of Neuro-Linguistic Programming really is. It has been said that people who study Neuro-Linguistic Programming live freely. They have the ability to access all different types of situations and make choices in how they choose to proceed instead of being led by instinct and emotion. How you think, feel, behave, and speak can all be choices you make that can help you lead the best life possible. NLP can be used throughout your daily life in a huge variety of ways. Some common reasons that people start using this are that they want to motivate other people, have control over their emotions, conquer their fears, communicate more effectively, and find success in life. There are many other reasons a person would take an interest in NLP. If you are unsure of who you can trust in your crowd NLP can seriously help. Understanding behaviors and actions of people can help to clue you in on what’s really going on around you. This falls into Sensory Awareness. It is amazing what you can learn from looking at someone’s body position and paying attention to things like their tone of voice. People really do tell you everything you need to know with very little conversation. Whether you are at your job or heading for a late-night party downtown honing these skills can keep you mentally and physically protected against predators. Knowing NLP techniques can also inform you when other people are using it for darker desires. Many people use these practices to become their best selves, however, others have more nefarious intent. Obviously, when you can adapt in a situation and make well-thought out choices you are going to be more successful. There is less of a chance that people will be able to take advantage of you. In addition, you will be able to better understand the people in your life. Weeding out the keepers from the trash is simpler when you can read the situation accurately and adjust so that you are working toward your desired outcome. Among the groups of the Dark Triad there is a conglomeration of personality traits that are oftentimes, seen in criminals. It is not terribly surprising to find that most criminals have quite a bit in common. Taking notice to these dark traits is a great way of figuring out if someone has malicious intent toward you or not. There are a variety of different dark traits that we see on an everyday basis. You may know someone who is very spiteful. Anyone that does something they don’t like will pay for it. Sometimes it will be petty retaliation but it can explode into something much more dangerous, depending on who you are dealing with. Criminals tend to be spiteful, as they have malicious intent with their transgressions. Another dark trait that you want to watch out for is egoism. When someone is so self-absorbed and focused on their own achievements that they will run everyone else around them into the ground, it is a major problem. Some criminals scramble their way to the top because of their giant egos and their ability to only care about themselves. Keeping an eye on a big ego can save you a lot of trouble, especially in relationships and business. Have you ever met someone that had loose morals? You know that person that really doesn’t have much regard for if what they are doing is right or wrong. Someone that even when they know what they are doing is wrong, does it anyway, and then just laughs it off. This is a personality trait referred to as moral disengagement. Obviously, the ability to commit a crime and not feel terrible about it is something common among criminals a pretty dark trait. Earlier we discussed Machiavellianism. That person that will go to any means to get what they want. They are the ones that are the masters of manipulation. The justification for what they are doing is always solid. When trying to track down criminals these are some of the hardest to catch as they tend to also be some of the smartest out there. Even experts of NLP can have a hard time locking this trait down. Entitlement or Psychological Entitlement are also dark traits that we commonly see in criminals and everyday adversaries. Unfortunately, the world's sense of entitlement has gone off the rails. Nowadays, it is natural to meet people that have a sense of entitlement and this can make it difficult to use this trait in determining somebody's true intent. Self-interest is another trait that you need to watch out for. We all have tendencies to be selfish, however, for some people it is to an extreme. They simply do not care what other people feel or want. This is commonly seen by people boasting about how much money they have or their status. in addition, their self-interest could be used to motivate them in gaining betterment in finances or society. Those that are self-interested also tend to be extremely manipulative. Then we have the narcissist. we spoke of the narcissist earlier, but their traits are very common among criminals. They have a need for attention and commonly and inflated sense of self. they will go to great extremes to prove that they are better than those that are around them. this could be in how they look, how they think, or how they act. The narcissist thinks that their ideas are the best and therefore criminal intent goes hand-in-hand with the narcissist. Psychopathy means that you are lacking in the ability to empathize with people. They have an extreme lack of concern where others are involved. This dark trait can also lead to a lack of self-control and extremely impulsive behaviors. Obviously, when thinking about criminals, this trait rings true for many of the extreme horrors we have witnessed in the past. The last dark trait that we think needs to be discussed is sadism. A sadist is a person that likes to inflict pain. In fact, they take pleasure in causing other people pain. This does not necessarily have to be physical pain. in fact, many sadists find joy and completely tearing you down mentally. A wide variety of criminal classes fall into this category and it is a common trait that we see in many of the people that are committing heinous crimes. Behavior Imitation Behavior imitation is something that can be used for good and for bad. Oftentimes, as children, we mimic the behavior of the people around us. It helps us to learn social norms. in addition, it helps us feel like we fit in to the crowd. Many traditions have been built off of people mimicking other people's behavior. As we continue to grow up we continue to imitate people around us. Here again, it makes us feel as if we belong. Additionally, it can help us build relationships and understand the people around us more easily. While, many people use behavior imitation for the right reasons there are many others who don't. Criminals who are socially awkward have a tendency of acting like the people around them. it can make it harder to discern the good guys from the bad guys. It is a manipulation tactic that works quite well when people don't exactly know how to behave appropriately. It is important to note that while some people are very good at mimicking those around them it will be quite obvious when others are trying to do this. Cases of extreme social awkwardness will not allow the person to genuinely behave like those that are around them. This can be a tip to seeing what they may have planned next. Another way that behavior imitation is prevalent with criminals is when they idolize someone or something. They will change their very persona to reflect that of which they have admiration for. A good example of this are people that still follow the ideals of Adolf Hitler. The new generation of Nazis mimic the ways of old because they still believe his blasphemous thoughts to be true. This is truly scary behavior imitation. Body Language A person’s body language is one of the biggest tells in how they are feeling and what they may be planning. The way a person moves and behaves while in a conversation, out in public, and at home gives great insight to what’s happening with them at that particular moment. Those who work on learning NLP techniques spend a ton of time studying about body language. Body language is how we speak without using words. It can suggest that you are happy, sad, open to conversation, or completely closed off from everyone. Not only is it shown through your actual body but also through your eyes. Paying attention to the eyes is also an important part of NLP. There are some truths to be found in body language that may not be what the words coming out of someone’s mouth are actually stating. It has been found that we gather more information from a person’s facial expressions, eyes, and body language than we ever could from their spoken words. So, learning how to read body language can help you in just about every situation you find yourself in. Learning how shady people act can help you in avoiding unwanted issues. When you first start learning about body language, you will be able to easily identify some emotions. Obviously, we all know what it looks like when a person is happy or sad. The signs of this can be seen easily but finding out when someone is anxious or uncomfortable can be a bit more difficult. Studying non-verbal cues will take you to every area of the body. For example, slightly dilated pupils may not be from a bright light but may in fact be due to arousal. If someone is constantly biting at their lip it could be a sign of stalling or higher levels of anxiety in the current situation. How a person is standing or sitting also gives us some clues as to how they are feeling. A person with their arms folded around them is less likely to want to be approached. Whereas, an open stance with your hands on your hips means you are likely in control of the situation or you may be aggressive. Learning these types of things can seriously help improve your ability to pick out a troublemaker in a crowd. If you have ever been in a room and noticed someone was acting kind of shifty. You know, like moving around the room frequently and during conversations they are unable to hold eye-contact. Your ability to notice these this is because most people have at least some basic knowledge on how to read a person’s body language. Your posture also plays a key role in what your body is saying to other people. People who slouch and tend to wrap their arms around themselves are typical closed off. They may be feeling unwelcome or anxious. On the other hand, an open posture with your chin up and shoulders back is very welcoming. It shows that you are open to conversation, friendly, and approachable. Not only does your body language help people decide how to approach you, theirs helps you decide about them. There are a plethora of different aspects to be considered with body language. The more you delve into NLP, the more pieces of body language you will pick up. It can seriously help when trying to identify those that are threatening and may have mal intent. Language Imitation Language imitation is another piece of NLP that should be taken into consideration. When we talk to someone, even if we speak the same language, it can be difficult for us to understand each other. Each individual has what is referred to as common language. Common language is simply the words a person uses frequently and understand better than others. When you are in a therapy session or at work and you are listening to someone talk, understanding what they are saying can be hard. It can feel as if they are speaking in a different language. This doesn’t work well for anyone as the person listening is actually learning anything. This is a major issue and can cause massive detriment to a company or a person’s mental status. Working to hear how someone talks, the phrases they use, and the tone that they have can help you succeed in language imitation. When you can speak in common language to the person or people you are addressing, you will be much more successful. Understanding will be promoted and what everyone gets out of what you have to say will be more beneficial. Mimicking someone’s language is more difficult than mimicking their body language. The more time you spend talking with a person, the easier it will be to pick up on their vocal habits. Someone that is very good at picking up other people’s common language can be a danger if they have intentions of doing harm. When we speak in a common language it promotes trust. Putting trust into someone that wants to use your language against you is obviously something you want to avoid. So, be careful when dealing with people that quickly change their voice to match those that are around them. The ones that pick up on little pieces of context and repeat them to gain sympathy, trust, or control. It may be hard to recognize, at first, but the more aware you become of your surrounding the easier this will be to spot. Criminals tend to be good at this parrot like behavior. They understand that to get people to like you they absolutely need to understand you. If control is what someone is looking for this is a good place to start and get their hooks in. So, while language imitation can help you and your therapist or employees relate, it can also be used to manipulate situations in favor of the person using this tactic. Chapter 4: The Behavioral Bases There are some behavioral bases that people that are prone to take advantage of others tend to have. The tactics they use can be quite varied, however, there are some that are persistently seen. Learning about these techniques, what they are, and how people around you may be using them can help keep you protected from their detrimental effects. While there are a ton of different tactics, there are some that are more frequently seen. These are the one’s that we will be focusing on. They are the ways that individuals influence and coerce you into doing exactly what they want, even if it is not particularly what you would choose to do. Avoiding this type of thing can help you maintain control of your own life and future. Brainwashing The first area that we want to look over is, brainwashing. Brainwashing is defined as someone being pressured into doing something wildly different from their beliefs. This is often accomplished by persistence and oftentimes force. Obviously, avoiding the effects of brainwashing is important to each and every one of us. Some have found limited information of brainwashing happening in the early 20th century. However, it was not something that really had many people interested. It was not until quite a while later that people started to see the true and terrifying nature of brainwashing. In the 1950’s the scare of brainwashing became a real thing. Other countries were using brainwashing techniques to control their soldiers. Basically, they were turning them into puppets that would do any and all things without question. America started to have true nerves about this when trusted military members started stating “truths” that were absolutely false. After this occurred, you found the words brainwashed and brainwashing everywhere. It is when it became a word that the world knew. It was cropping up all over American newspapers and there were more and more stories coming out about brainwashing and the things it could get you to do. Brainwashing, at this point, was almost entirely geared toward controlling governments. However, as time went on, people started to see that it was not only used in politics and war settings. They were seeing brainwashing happening all around them. The definition eventually led to include the thoughts of persuasion or propaganda to get people to purchase items or follow ideals of others. There are a variety of different ways that one may be brainwashed. Here again, some are easily recognizable while others are much more subtle. The in your face varieties are, obviously, easier to see and understand. This can involve things like hypnosis and isolation. The more subtle varieties are increasingly harder to see and protect yourself against. Hypnosis is the version of brainwashing that most people think of when they hear the word. It is a common practice to help change a behavior in someone. It can, obviously, be used to do very good things. Conversely, it can be used to completely destroy a person and make them do things completely against their nature. Hypnosis can be accomplished in a variety of different ways. Typically, there will be a repetitive noise that just about matches a heartbeat. The tone of the hypnotists voice and the surroundings in the room will also play a role. All of these things are used to cause a trance-like state in the person being hypnotized. From there, once trance state is gained, there is very little that a skilled hypnotist can’t get you to do. Another way that people brainwash others is by playing on our own vulnerabilities. Peer pressure is a type of brainwashing. When you make someone feel less than the crowd they become vulnerable and easily manipulated due to the drive to want to fit in. This can be seen all over the world and in just about every age group. As humans, we have an inane need to fit in. Confusion Doctrines and Metacommunication are also ways that people have been able to brainwash others. By putting together lectures and written materials that are hard to understand but have a consistent and clear message, you can make people believe a different way. Their acceptance of the clear messages is more easily absorbed due to the fact it’s the only piece of what is being said that is understood. Verbal and physical abuse are also ways that someone could brainwash another. By tearing someone down, they become more accepting of other beliefs. Oftentimes, the abuser will also be the one to “build them back up”. This causes an odd sense of adoration from the person being abused to the abuser. People are also known to be controlled by measures of isolation, fear, or guilt. Unfortunately, there are a huge variety of techniques that people may use to try and brainwash another person. For most of us, we will never experience these darker ways of brainwashing, however, we do experience some of it on a daily basis. Companies use brainwashing techniques to encourage consumers to buy their products. Have you ever gotten the jingle for a commercial stuck in your head and no matter what you do you can’t get it out? Well, this is a form of brainwashing. It is sticking an idea in your head that you just can’t shake, even if it is about a product you don’t want. As it continues to sit and fester in your mind, there is a better likelihood that you will head out and give their product a try. Not only do we find this happening in commercials but also in print ads, catch phrases, and company logos. Everything a brand does to get you to buy their products is, for all intents and purposes, brainwashing. Making you believe you will be happier, healthier, or more productive by using whatever it is they have to offer, even if there is no truth to it at all. Being aware of the fact that brainwashing is all around you is the first step in making sure that you are thinking for yourself. Propaganda is everywhere and so is the influence of other people whether average everyday people or political figures. Know that most people have an agenda. Recognizing brainwashing tactics isn’t always difficult but it can be hard to avoid. People that fall into the dark triad will frequently try and brainwash their victims. This is perfectly clear with our example of Jim Jones. His cult was enthralled by him even though he had malicious intent. It is not surprising that egomaniacs want to have control of those around them and they will use any means necessary to get it. Including but not limited to brainwashing. As more learning in the realm of Dark Psychology happens, the newer tactics of brainwashing are uncovered. Knowledge is absolutely, power. So, learning more about what people are doing to control others minds can help to keep us all safer from this detrimental tactic in the future. Manipulation Manipulation is another area that you need to be very careful with. Let’s face it, we have all likely manipulated someone at some point in our lives. Some people do it without even realizing that they are while others are completely calculated and intend on manipulating others around them for their own gain. Recognizing manipulation can vary in difficulty, depending on how good of a manipulator you are dealing with. Psychological manipulation is not always a bad thing. If you love someone and know that what they are doing is harming them and you subtly make suggestions to help them correct the behavior, it can truly help them. This type of manipulation happens frequently but is honestly quite harmless. Depending on how well you know someone it could actually be very easy to manipulate them. Manipulators tend to use our vulnerabilities against us. Knowing someone quite well can open up the door to manipulation as they understand what makes you tick and what buttons they can push to get you to do what they want. Obviously, this could be used for nefarious reasons and you need to be careful who you put your trust into. Those who enjoy manipulating others won’t be exceptionally aggressive. They understand that manipulation is an art and a skill that you need to hone. While their intentions may be malicious, you would never know it. That is one of the keys to manipulation. A person that is willing to intentionally manipulate others for their own gain, tend to be a bit ruthless. They don’t particularly care if what they do will cause you harm. Manipulators control their victim in a variety of ways. Using things like negative and positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement is an awful tactic. It’s giving someone an out on something they don’t want to do and getting rewarded for bad behavior. For example, allowing a child to eat ice cream for dinner if they clean the entire house. While this is pretty minor manipulation, it is a solid look at it. Using positive reinforcement like praise, fake sympathy, gifts, and laughter to get what you want is almost just as bad. You are fooling people into thinking you feel a way that you absolutely don’t so that you will, eventually, get what you want. Manipulation also, typically, has lots of lying going on. It can be full on lies or partial mistruths. Lies are used to protect the actual intent of the manipulator. They will vehemently deny doing anything wrong. They do this with diversion tactics and evasion. Giving answers that lead you in a different direction or that don’t really answer your questions at all. Being vague is absolutely a quality of the manipulator. Shaming and villainizing victims is another way that manipulators gain control. When you can make someone feel small and then build them back up, you have a lot of control on what they will become. With fake niceness and underlying villainy, the manipulator can always find ways to get what they want from you. Making an innocent person look like a villain is another common tactic that manipulators use. It causes the victim to become defensive and many will take defense as guilt coming out, even when this is not the case at all. While all of these tactics are underhanded, they are also all quite negative. What about the manipulator that goes about it a different way? Instead of spreading fear and tearing you down, they are charming and charismatic. They take control of the crowd simply by being there. They seduce people into doing whatever it is that they want. These are some of the worst manipulators and frequently they are the hardest to spot because they are clever. What we have shown you here are just a few of the techniques that manipulators use to get what they want. They also use things like anger, judgement, and projection to get the end that they are shooting for. While manipulation can be harmless on occasion, the majority of manipulation is anything but harmless. We, as humans, have free will and someone taking control of that is a major problem. Manipulation is used in all facets of life. It could come from your loved ones, co-workers, bosses, media, politicians, and more. You should make yourself aware of how people are acting toward you and be suspicious of their intent until you actually get to know them. However, do we really ever know anyone? A person with true mal intent will keep their intentions well covered. This brings the question of, can we actually put our trust into anyone? So, how do you know if you are susceptible to manipulation? Well there are very specific characteristics that manipulators look to exploit in people. If you have low self-esteem, are immature, naive, dependent, trusting, altruistic, masochistic, or greedy there is a good chance that a manipulator will seek you out. These characteristics are easier to control. Bending the will of someone that doesn’t think much of them self is going to be much easier than someone that knows their worth and value. Elderly, trusting, and lonely people are also very vulnerable in terms of being manipulated. In addition, young and easily influenced people are more vulnerable. Finding the perfect person to take advantage of is not a hard thing to do. Recognizing your own shortcomings and attributes can help you avoid being manipulated in the future. What motivates a manipulator to manipulate, you may wonder? There are a variety of features that we see in true manipulation. What drives manipulation can vary but it mostly comes down to power and control over other people for personal gain. The gain can be financially or socially but there is almost always some sort of gain for the one doing the manipulation. It’s funny to think that some manipulators don’t even know that they are doing it. These individuals likely do a lot of lying to themselves. This allows them to disregard their emotions. It may also help them deal with issues like phobias or problems with commitment. Most of the time, someone who is manipulating others, knows exactly what they are doing. They may just be bored and feel like manipulation is a fun game that no one really gets hurt. However, this is a backwards way of thinking. Trying to force someone to do what you want them to, for whatever reason, is always wrong. When looking at the reasoning behind manipulation, more often than not, it is for the financial or social gains that come with manipulation. Taking advantage of easily influenced elderly people by providing them with company and compassion so you can steal their money is a common way to manipulate for financial gain. Manipulation is certainly a form of control. People that will manipulate others tend to have a need for control. This can be at the workplace, at home, or out in the public. They want to advance themselves and they always want to end up on top. Wanting to do well for yourself is not an issue but when you will do it at the expense of others, it becomes one. Protecting yourself against manipulators can be easier said than done. Especially, if someone is well-practiced in the techniques of manipulation. Learning to recognize the signs of manipulation can absolutely help you avoid it. In addition, working on your own self-esteem can help you dramatically. Manipulators, as noted, play on your weaknesses. Taking the time to self-actualize and know where you are weak will help you patch up those vulnerabilities. In turn, you will be less likely to be manipulated. Respecting yourself is another great way to avoid manipulation. A person that has respect for them self is less likely to bend to the will of others, regardless of how well-practiced in manipulation they are. Being upfront and assertive can also help you avoid the behaviors of the manipulator. When you know what you want, they don’t, typically, want to take the time and effort to change your mind. They will move on to easier prey, leaving you to lead the life that you want to lead without the influence of a manipulator. One other action you can adopt that will help you avoid being manipulated is to set boundaries from the word go. When an expectation is set in stone people won’t want to do the work it will take to change it. Knowing yourself and your limits is, in general, important but becomes vastly more important when dealing with someone that is keen on manipulation. Obviously, criminals tend to be manipulators. So do those that fall into the Dark Triad. Manipulation is one of the simplest forms of control and with practice people can turn people into puppets quite easily. This is how cult leaders gain such large followings. Additionally, it is how people like Stalin, Hitler, and others were able to gain control of entire countries and get the people to jump on the bandwagon of their beliefs. Persuasion Persuasion is another behavioral base that can be used for dark desires. We have, likely, all been persuaded to do something in our lives that we didn’t necessarily want to do. Typically, it is quite harmless. A little task at work or at home that isn’t our favorite, but we get talked into doing it anyway. Maybe we are coerced to do it for some reward or maybe we are simply just trying to be compliant, so we don’t get in trouble. Persuasion can be used in a variety of ways and it is surprising what people can be persuaded to do. Sometimes people can be persuaded to do atrocious things that are absolutely against their very nature. This is, of course, less common but happens more often than most people realize. The techniques of persuasion vary but there are some that are fairly easy to spot. Others will go without notice and these are much more dangerous types of persuasion. So, how do people persuade others to do just exactly what they want? Some will use the foot in the door principal. This is explained quite simply as asking for a small favor before you ask for a big one. Once you get a person to say yes once it is easier to get them to say yes again. The small favor will go hand in hand with the larger favor. A good example of this would be asking someone for some loose change because you forgot it in your car and it is lunch time then proceeding to ask them to share their lunch because you didn’t bring that either. On the opposite side of the foot in the door principle there is what is referred to as door in the face practices. Rather than asking for something small followed by a request for something bigger you ask for something huge then something small. This tactic works very well. You can ask you best friend for ten thousand dollars and it is likely they will say no. Once they do you can ask for a simple twenty and they will be much more likely to oblige. This type of persuasion is dangerous but easy to see if you work on being attuned to what people are doing and saying. You really need to pay attention to what they are actually saying or asking. Humans tend to be fairly consistent in their beliefs and commitments. Persuasive people can pray on this behavior. Here again, a person can get you to agree to something small that you would normally do, then turn it into something much larger. Because you have already made a commitment to them it is more likely that you will follow through with their bigger scheme. Persuasive people may also act like they have some authority, even when they don’t. This is done because we, as people, learn respect for authority from the time we are little. When we are in front of someone that has authority, we tend to give them respect and do as they ask. This is especially true in the workplace. Misplaced authority is a great way to persuade people to do your dirty work for you. One of the easiest forms of persuasion to detect are those that come in the form of being “social proof”. Believing something to be true simply because it is commonly expected with no empirical data to back it up. We see this sort of persuasion in groups of friends or workers. One person comes up with something and everyone else simply goes along with it rather than thinking for themselves. Reciprocation is another form of persuasion. If someone does something for you, we naturally feel inclined to do something for them. A persuasive person will do what they can to make you feel indebted to them. By doing so, you may end up doing something you truly don’t want to because you feel obligated. You want to be careful who you are asking favors of. When looking at the most commonly used types of persuasion we need to look at scarcity. This is the you better hurry quick and get this item before it is gone. We widely see it in sales and marketing tactics. When a person believes there is only a small number of something or a limited time on a deal it is much more likely that they will want it. As you can see, this is a great strategy for businesses. This gives you a good look at how persuasive people function. They tend to be a bit underhanded in working to get the things that they believe are important. Criminals may be very good in the art of persuasion. With skill in this dark tactic, gaining a following and people that will do the deeds you want can become exceptionally simple. As noted, seeing some of these techniques is relatively simple, spotting others will take time and dedication. Learning NLP can help you spot the persuader more easily. Deception Along with brainwashing, manipulation, and persuasion comes deception. Another trait that is studied in Dark Psychology. Deception is something we come into contact with on a daily basis. It can be very small and harmless, or it can bring true burden to a person's life. Being deceptive takes practice, just like any other skill you can hone it with practice. Criminals and unjust people focus on deception and think of it as an art form. An example of a small deception is to tell someone you love their shirt when you actually hate it. We do this to spare people’s feelings and to avoid feeling uncomfortable with telling people what we actually think. Even the most honest people use deception on others. You may not realize it but not only do we deceive other people but oftentimes we also deceive ourselves. When we tell ourselves lies it can be both helpful and harmful. Consistently telling yourself that you are worthy of love or that you can meet a goal even when you, realistically, don’t believe these things is empowering when your brain starts to believe it. On the contrary, you may be seeing delusions and while your rational brain knows they aren’t there, the lies convince you that they are. This can lead to psychosis and other mental health problems. Throughout the years there have been a number of practices to pick out the liars or deceivers. This is seen in testing, like that which is done with a polygraph. Lie detectors are oftentimes discredited. This is because people that have disorders that make them exceptionally anti-social and those with the inability to empathize tend to pass a polygraph with flying colors. This leaves the worst of the worst scott free because they can “trick” the test. Polygraphs end up catching good people that made bad mistakes, generally a more honest type of person. When it comes down to it, even the most honest of people, will tell lies. It is considered to be part of human nature. It is likely a part that is needed. Sure, giant scandals come from big lies and criminals tend to lie more than anyone but saving your best friends feelings is not always a bad thing. Finding a balance is important and realizing why it is exactly that you are lying. Criminals tend to be liars. They constantly want to deceive people, so they get the desired outcome they are looking for. As noted, they hone this skill of deception which can make it insanely hard to notice. The normal “tells” of lying don’t exist as much when dealing with a narcissist or a psychopath. Being cautious about who you put your trust into is the best form of protection against deception. Deception comes in many different forms. It may be a white lie or a heavy lie to a boss, friend, family member, or others. I could also look like flirting. NLP teaches us to read other people’s body language. A woman or a man can project body language to make someone think they are interested just to get their way. A good example of this is the woman that shows off her form to get out of a ticket. By flirting with the cop she is deceiving him into thinking he has a chance, so, he lets her go. Body language is probably the best detection you will have from people skilled in the form of deception. Sometimes it may be obvious. You should always be wary of people that are mimicking other people’s body language. You may actually see it change as they stroll from group to group. Instantly be on your guard with people like this as they are much more apt to deceive and take advantage of you. Covert Emotional Manipulation Dark Psychology also spends time looking at Covert Emotional Manipulation. It is more commonly referred to as, CEM. CEM is a way to gain true power over someone without them even realizing it is happening. You will be so enthralled that these sneaky tactics will have you doing things you would not normally agree to. We have already talked about manipulation but there are so many different forms of it and this one is pretty important. It not only allows criminals and people with mal intent into your life it also breaks you down mentally. The effects of this type of manipulation can last forever if you are not careful. As noted, it is insanely subtle, which means looking for the red flags are very important. Covert Emotional Manipulation looks different depending on the people involved. Oftentimes, the victim will be slowly made to feel as if they can’t do anything without the other. It is a strange sort of codependency that happens over time. This happens without manipulation on occasion, the difference is when your partner is doing it intentionally to get you to behave or think differently. It may start with offers of help for simple tasks that you usually do on your own. They may follow it up with a critique to make you question your ability to do it. It starts small but they will continue to poke at it until you start to truly believe you can’t do it on your own. You can see it worked into all kinds of things and a ton of relationships. Depending on who you have allowed to do this to you, it could be mostly harmless. On the other hand, there are a lot of people with less than genuine intentions that could take this to an extreme. This type of manipulation can turn it to flat out brainwashing. In that case, it is possible that you will lose your free will forever. People that use CEM against other people pay great attention to detail. This can be endearing as it appears as if they are learning about you. In reality, they are observing your behavior, learning what makes you tick. This will grant them access on how to manipulate your emotions subtly to get what they want. They are truly hunting for your weaknesses. The heinous people and criminals that do this in life are calculating. They tend to have bigger plans and you are simply playing a role. They have no care or regard for how you feel or for the damage they are causing you. All they can see is the outcome that they are striving for. Finding that they are unable to ever sustain relationships is not surprising because of the selfish nature of how they are wired. As time goes on CEM turns into something else. What started out as little jabs that looked like they were made from love, become something much darker. As you start to lose control and bend your will the aggressor will pounce. They can become domineering. In addition, they will start to tear you down piece by piece to gain complete control. Playing with someone’s emotions is a great way to gain control over them. Some people would rather bombard someone with love to get them to do what they want, rather than being more crass or crude about it. Love bombarding is very typical of the narcissist. It is it’s own form of manipulation and it can be downright cruel in reality. You will feel like the most important person in someone’s world. You will go along with what they say hook, line, and sinker because you truly trust in what they say. Once this person has you there they can easily force their will and beliefs onto you. Fighting against this is extremely difficult for some people. Becoming solid in your belief system will make it more difficult for someone to pray on your emotions. Another way to combat this dark tendency is to work on really knowing yourself. When you spend the time to meditate, self- actualize, and maintain control of yourself it is much easier to fend off attacks on your emotions. When someone manipulates your emotions, it can have detrimental impact for the rest of your life. Narcissists and Psychopaths do not, oftentimes, have the ability to have true feelings. They are shut off, in a way. So, them playing with yours is a simple way to gain control of you and the situation they are in. Practicing the art of NLP can also give you signs as to when these types of people are trying to harm you. Gut feelings and red flags should be paid attention to. Naturally, we have instincts and sometimes something just feels off from the beginning. Maybe you meet someone and they seem just a little too perfect or you just feel a bit uncomfortable around them, don’t disregard these thoughts and feelings. We are wired to sense danger. This is not just physical danger that we sense but also emotional and mental danger. The phrase, “go with your gut”, is a good one and one that can help you avoid unpleasant situations. Chapter 5: Non-Verbal and Verbal Communication Communication comes in two different categories, verbal and non-verbal. Understanding both of them can help you understand people better, as a whole. We need to look at them separately and discuss the details to promote a solid base of knowledge around communication. Let’s start with verbal communication. Not only do good communication skills make it easier for you to understand other people it also makes it easier for them to understand you. While some people are very effective communicators others truly need to work on it. Taking a look in the mirror and participating in some communication activities can help you understand how well you are communicating with the people around you. You may be surprised to find that you have some work to do. As it sounds, verbal communication is communication with words. This piece seems obvious, however, did you know that there are four different types of verbal communication? Most people don’t look at it this closely, however, it can help us understand what people are really trying to say to us. Each type of verbal communication can give us insight into ourselves, as well as, others. The first type is intrapersonal communication. This is the conversations we have with ourselves internally. While we figure out a difficult problem or are working out our grocery list, we all spend time in our own heads talking. Intrapersonal communication is very different between people. Some of us are very good at building ourselves up while others tear themselves apart with their thoughts. It is not uncommon for criminals and those that fall into the Dark Triad to have terrible intrapersonal communication skills. They may literally feel as if they have a tiny devil inside their brain that always wins over the even smaller angel. Intrapersonal communication should not be confused with schizophrenia, that condition is quite different. The next type of verbal communication is interpersonal communication. This is the conversation that you have with just one other person. Sometimes, people handle one on one conversations very well because it is more personal. In addition to being more personal, it also tends to leave you a bit more vulnerable. This is because the sole focus of the conversation is between the two of you. If someone is trying to manipulate you, it is likely they are going to try and get you off on your own. Working against someone one-on-one is always going to be easier than trying to persuade or manipulate a crowd. On your own, you need to keep your defenses up. People that are trying to manipulate you will spend the time to look at your verbal and nonverbal communication skills. This helps them to pinpoint what they need to do to get you to bend to their will. Then there is small-group verbal communication. Obviously, there will be more than two people involved here, however, a small group for verbal communication is not exactly defined. It is a number of people that can all be actively involved in the conversation. Think of things like team meetings at work or press conferences. Everyone is taking their turn to give their opinions and thoughts. Small group communication is where most people thrive. It's not nearly as intense as a one-on-one conversation and it is not as intimidating as speaking in front of a large crowd. You will still need to pay attention to your verbal and nonverbal skills when dealing with a small group to make sure that you are promoting clear and concise understanding of what it is that you are saying. Manipulators that are very charismatic thrive in this type of conversation. They are good at getting the attention of the group. In turn, they are good at getting that group to see things from their point of view. It is more of a game to them than anything else. Gaining control is all they are looking for and some do it very successfully. The last type of verbal communication is public communication. When dealing with public communication there is, typically, only one speaker. They will be addressing a larger crowd. Election speeches are a very good example of this. You need to remember that many people will conduct themselves differently in public than they do in private. Looking for drastic changes can clue you in to the darker tendencies of verbal communication. Conquering the art of good communication is hard. There are a variety of factors that equal good communication and the words you pick are only part of it. Most people need to work on their communication skills but be aware that those that are scheming against you will focus on it. The way a criminal communicates verbally can make or break their plans. Being careful with what they say they are able to more easily persuade and manipulate those that are around them. When you have improved communication skills it can make it easier to pick up on the trick’s others are using around you. So, what does it take to communicate effectively in a verbal manor? You need to be friendly and kind in the things that you say. In addition, thinking before you speak plays a major role. Those that prattle on without thinking tend to be looked down on and people tend to stop listening as they simply never stop talking. If you have this bad habit you will find that people look at their cell phones more while you are talking, talk with others around them, or simply go into a trance state until you stop talking. Your word choice also is a component that needs to be considered. Thinking about the crowd that is in front of you or the person that you are speaking with individually can help you communicate with them effectively. Knowing what their common languages and the words they typically use can give you clues as to how you need to handle them. When you take these types of things into consideration people are more apt to open up to you and tell you what is really going on. It gives you some common ground with them and makes you more relatable. Effective verbal communication also takes confidence. When you are solid in the things you are saying it shows. Be well prepared with your thoughts and people will be able to understand you. Giving others time to speak their piece is also very important in verbal communication. When someone feels like you don't give them time to talk they start to tune you out. It's very rude when there is only one person talking and other people have things to say. Obviously, if you are giving a speech the people that are there are not going to be doing much talking. So, you will need to take your surroundings in the consideration to figure out how much you should actually be saying and how much you should be listening. Sometimes, it is very hard to say exactly what you mean. Being concise in what you are saying is important. If there is a lot of fluff in your thoughts it can be confusing to the person listening. This could lead to questions that do not relate to what you are talking about at all. In addition, telling a story in a streamed line is important. If you jump from one point to another it causes a lot of confusion and a lack of Interest. Here again, spending the time to think about what you want to say before you say it will be advantageous. Verbal communication can be really difficult for some people. They may not be comfortable speaking in public or exactly the opposite and become increasingly awkward when put into a one on one situation. There are different strategies that can help you become better at verbal communication, regardless of what type makes you uncomfortable. There are a variety of different activities that you can try to make yourself a better and more comfortable verbal communicator. With a few minutes a day you can find the tact and confidence to say what you really mean. This can be a major benefit in life and lead to less misunderstandings and drama. You can get yourself a word of the day calendar, thesaurus, or use an app for a similar type of thing. By broadening your vocabulary, you will have the words you need regardless of the crowd you are in. Be mindful of things like common language. If you want people to listen, they need to be able to understand what you are saying. So, using the words that the people around you use will ensure they are on the same page as you. Expressing our wants and needs can be difficult especially for kids and teenagers. This is partially due to all of the electronic devices we are stuck in nowadays. Sending a message makes it easy to feel confident and say what you mean but when that same thing needs to be said out loud it can be difficult. Parents can help their children with communication by making time without electronics. In addition, encouraging talking without distraction and taking a genuine interest in what they are saying and feeling without overreacting can promote better verbal communication. Also, making sure that you communicate your feelings, needs, wants, and Thoughts with your kids will encourage them to do the same with you. This goes to more people than just your children. Being open and honest with those that are around you will help them be open and honest with you. Of course, you want to be careful and not put too much trust in people. Keeping some things to yourself is advantageous and ensuring that you aren't taken advantage of. We all know that practice makes perfect. If you are trying to become more comfortable with public speaking, you need to practice. You can start by going through your speech out loud but by yourself. Then when you feel confident with what you have get a group of trusted friends and family members together. Present your speech to them. You can gain constructive criticism from those that care about you and it can truly help to calm the nerves. You can practice this way many times to build your level of confidence. As you become more confident it will be easier to address larger crowds. Working on things like your pitch, tone, and pace can also make you a more confident speaker. When you truly believe the words, you are saying and can say them with conviction you will be more confident. Practicing will certainly help here. Confidence is not only seen in these aspects. It also goes with your nonverbal communication. We will look at how to build confidence and self-esteem with nonverbal communication As you move through this chapter. These are only a couple of the many verbal communication skill improving activities that are out there. If you truly want to learn to communicate better there are a ton of sources out there to help you. With a bit of work and dedication you will be much more prepared to vocalize your wants, needs, and ideas. This can give you some advantages throughout your life that a lack of communication skills could hinder. Including things like promotions at work or getting hired for certain jobs. Heading to a job interview well- prepared and well-articulated is definitely going to help you land it. If you are lacking in communication skills, you can basically say goodbye to that wonderful job you're working for. Non-Verbal Communication Now we need to take a look at non-verbal communication. Have you heard of the phrase “it’s not what you say it’s how you say it”? There is true meaning behind this as, what we say matters, sure, but the non-verbal cues we give are even more important. Earlier we discussed quite a bit bout Neuro-Linguistic Programming and your non-verbal communication plays a major role in this. It has been said that more than sixty percent of what you say is in your body language not your actual words. Learning about non-verbal communication can help you in a variety of ways. You will be more perceptive to what people are actually trying to say. You may also pick up on lies or deceit more easily. Figuring out a person’s true motivation can become much more clear when you start to pay attention to what their body is saying. Paralanguage is part of non-verbal communication. It encompasses a couple of different areas that can help you communicate more effectively. The main pieces of it are tone, cadence, and inflection. All of these elements play a key role in what you are actually saying. The tone of your voice plays a pretty big role in non-verbal communication, as well. It can draw a listener in or make them totally tune out. A voice that is monotone does not have any inflection. Every word comes out with the same tone and volume. The cadence of a monotone speaker tends to be slow and steady throughout their words. This can be very hard to listen too. When you are talking with someone changing your tone can help to give them clues as to how you are feeling. It allows for better communication as we are able to express our emotions through the tone of our voices. In public speaking, having a great tone will get you everywhere. Voice inflection is just as important, and both play a big role in effective verbal communication. If you have a flat voice or you notice that people drift off while you are talking you can practice this. Find your favorite book and practice reading it aloud with different inflections and tones. This can help you during regular conversations to get away from the monotone nature of some voices. You will notice that people around you are more engaged and what you say matters more than it did before. Para communication is only a piece of non-verbal communication. What else do we need to consider when trying to be better non-verbal communicators. This is a tough question as there is quite a bit that encompasses non-verbal communication. We can take a bit of time and look at the tip of the iceberg but know that people spend years studying non-verbal communication. Reading someone’s facial expressions is a major tell in non-verbal communication. There are many exercises that teach us what facial expressions are saying. Some of them are very straightforward. If you look at someone that is smiling it, typically, means they are happy or enjoying what they are doing. However, a smile can be deceiving. Smiling can also be a sign of anxiety. When people want to fit in but don’t know how to do that they will smile to look more approachable and less nervous. Tight lips can give away these smiles. You may also notice that a smile on someone’s face simply looks fake. If you feel this way, it likely is. That goes along with going with your gut. The more you notice about someone’s expression the more you can tell about them. Sure, picking out a smile or a frown is easy but what about the smaller harder to see expressions. Our faces have up to ten thousand different movement patterns and believe it or not they all mean something. Learning more about what facial twitches and twists mean can help you pick out the rats among the group. Kinesics, or body movement, also play a major role in non-verbal communication. The gestures that we make during conversations tell a lot about how we are feeling. If we are interested in what is being said or we are nervous about it. Paying attention to how people’s body’s are moving will tell you volumes about what they are thinking and feeling. Think about the last meeting you were sitting in, did you see the person nervously drumming their fingers on the table or their thighs? This is a sign of boredom, irritability, and nervousness. This can be very distracting to a group and should be avoided. If you are one to take to these body movements keep in mind that the best thing you can do is keep your hands on the table. Clasping them can help keep you from the annoying drumming that your feelings are pushing you toward. We are used to the meaning of some body movements. When we are having a conversation and someone is looking at us and nodding as we speak, we know this means they are paying attention and actively listening to what we have to day. Some may be nodding but not actually engaged. You can see this through their eye movement. This could be from boredom or preoccupied thinking. While both of these examples are easy to spot there are a few body movements that aren’t as easy to determine meaning from. Someone that frequently clears their throat is likely nervous about what they are saying, however, they may just be trying to get someone’s attention that is distracted. Nervous ticks are commonly seen in people that are going to do something against the law or something harmful to others. Unless you are deep in the traits of the Dark Triad, you likely feel some sort of guilt when doing something wrong. This can lead to body movement clues as your body is rejecting the act that is about to be performed. Noticing these ticks can give you great insight as to the intentions of a person. It can be a simple twitch of the hand or odd mouth movements. It could even be a jerking of the head or other limbs. So, while bouncing of knees or drumming of fingers are consistent views that somebody is nervous or bored. There are tells when somebody has something worse on their mind. Another major component in non-verbal communication is eye contact. It can be very difficult for some people to maintain eye contact. This can make you feel as if they are not listening or that they are Shifty. For some, it is neither of these things. They simply find it to be uncomfortable to look somebody in the eyes while talking. Maintaining a certain level of eye contact with somebody you are talking to shows that you are interested and engaged in what they are saying. This does not mean that you need to stare at them the entire time that they are talking. However, frequent eye contact can truly help improve communication. Experts have found that when looking somebody in the eye it can be more comfortable when you look at their other features as well. Varying your site to look at their eyelids nose and around the other areas of their face can make it less uncomfortable. Of course, you will also want to take the time to actually look them in the eyes as they are speaking. People that have committed crimes or that intend on committing crimes have a hard time maintaining contact. It has been said that the eyes are the window to the soul and there is definitely some truth in this. When you notice how somebody's eyes move and look it can help you to determine their intent whether it be good or bad. When looking at nonverbal communication and people that truly command attention a lot of it is said through their posture. Your posture says a lot about not only you and your confidence levels but also your position in life. When we talked about your posture we're not only speaking of when you're standing up at also plays a role when you are sitting down. For example, if you are trying to show that you are confident, strong, and self-assured you will stand with your shoulders back, your back straight, and your head held high. People, naturally, will think of these positive things about you if you are standing in this position. It truly does command attention. On the other hand, if you are slouched in your body is in general facing downward it makes you look indecisive. It may also make people think that you are weak and unable to take control of a situation. Open and closed posture also play a role in how people perceive you. If you are accepting of people coming up and talking to you, you will want to use an open posture. This looks like a pretty relaxed position. Your shoulders and hips will be equally spread and you won't be standing at attention. You will leave your stomach exposed rather than crossing your arms over top of it. Standing this way makes you more approachable. It will make it so that people trust you more easily and are willing to have conversations with you at any point. A closed pasture going to have the exact opposite effect. If you were sitting in the chair with your arms crossed over your stomach and your legs crossed, as well, you are telling people to stay away. This type of positioning can make it look like you are very bored. It also tells people that you are unapproachable and unwilling to open up to them. This causes distrust and tends to lead to poor communication. Proxemics is another important factor in nonverbal communication. This genuinely has to do with people's personal space and their comfort levels. Most people want you to stay outside of their “personal bubble”. Most are comfortable standing in conversation with somebody they don't know when that person is a foot or more away from them. Obviously, the people that we care about can be closer to us without making us uncomfortable. This goes for family members, people you are in relationships with, and close friends. Taking notice to not only other people's personal space but your own is important. Some people that would like to victimize you will try and get in close. They realize that touching somebody makes a connection. They will Honan on their ability to come into close contact with you and then take advantage of it. So making sure that you stand a reasonable distance away from people will stop this behavior from occurring. In addition, if somebody is a bit touchy feely there is nothing wrong with telling them that it makes you uncomfortable. Letting them know that it is not okay to be in your personal space can save you from harm in the future. In a business atmosphere, you want to make sure that you are not overly far away from someone. If you are very far away during a conversation and it may seem as if you are disinterested. It is easier to get distracted while somebody is talking if you're not near to them. Knowing the appropriate distance four conversations is important for most people. It's really can help you to communicate more effectively. The last area to look at and nonverbal communication is psychological changes. These can be quite hard to notice but with practice it can become easier. This type of communication is related to our emotions. When we use the word psychological changes we are talking about noticing if somebody starts to sweat or their face turns red from embarrassment. These are surefire ways to tell that somebody is feeling uncomfortable or uneasy about their current situation. If you are dealing with a friend that gets teary-eyed while you're talking you probably need to change your tactics to make them feel more comfortable. Putting somebody at ease when they are feeling nervous can truly help to build your rapport with them. Of course, you want to be careful when dealing with people that you don't know very well. They can pick up on your psychological changes and, in turn, use them against you. Communication Skills It is possible that after reading this you have found that your nonverbal communication skills are lacking. There are absolutely different activities that you can do to help him prove what you are saying to others. Taking the time to spend a few minutes a day working on your nonverbal communication can lead to a more successful life. This is because people will understand how you're truly feeling and thinking as you tried to express yourself to them. You find the taking a few minutes out of your day to think about your facial expressions can work in your favor. Some people have a very hard time controlling their expression and this can make others uncomfortable when they are not interested or object to the things that are being said. Being aware of the look on your face can help set people at ease. In addition, it will help them trust you more and listen to the things that you have to say. Another thing that can help you to improve your nonverbal communication is to pay attention to how you act. When you are standing in a room and talking with somebody how close are you standing to them? Giving them more or less space can help improve the communication between you. Remember to close is not good, however, too far away is also not good. There is a fun experiment that you can try where two people stand fairly far apart and two steps at a time come closer and closer together. When one person starts to feel uncomfortable, they raise their hand to tell the other to stop. This gives you a good look at what most people's personal space is. As noted, working on your tone and inflection can also improve your communication. Alongside of this is eye contact. Many people struggle with the right amount of eye contact and it can make you seem shifty. Practicing these things together can improve overall communication skills. This goes for both verbal and nonverbal skills. People who effectively communicate verbally and non-verbally tend to have higher levels of self-esteem. This is because they truly feel understood. The people around them can listen to them talk and gain true insight from them. This is great for businesses and personal lives. Taking the time to work on your communication skills can absolutely help to improve your life, overall. Opening up your stance and relaxing a bit can help improve the confidence that you have in yourself. It can make talking with others much easier. An open stance will naturally make you more relaxed and approachable. You won't be as afraid to talk to those people that are coming up to you as they will also be relaxed because of your stance. When people are coming up to you and talking it's going to encourage you to talk back. Being aware of how you look and what you are saying well, naturally make you feel more confident. Taking notice to small twitches that might show nervousness and correcting them will also make you more confident. Self-esteem can be built quite easily, and your communication skills will play a major role in it. When you decide to start working on yourself and trying to like yourself more focusing on your verbal and nonverbal communication will certainly help you along the way. Some of you folks may be exceptionally confident when talking to an individual person or small crowds. However, when you get in front of a large crowd as it can be increasingly more intimidating. Training yourself to be confident and have great self-esteem can be difficult in a situation where there are thousands of people listening to you. Remembering that your body language speaks just as loud as your words will help you when put in these situations. When you are able to relate to the thousands of people looking at you and they are able to relate to you it will truly help build you up. On the other side of that many people are great at talking to a group of people but on an individual level they struggle. Talking one-on-one or with a very small group of people can be emotionally intimidating. It can make someone feel as if they have to be more vulnerable than they want to be. This goes along with the eyes being the window to the soul. We tend to be in closer proximity when working with only one person or a small group of people. They will be able to more easily see what's going on with you while you talk. Most people have at least one person they are comfortable talking with. It is great practice to spend time with that person and see how you react while in a one-on-one situation. Paying special attention to the tone of your voice, your body language, your eyes, and your facial expressions can lead you to more confidence when dealing with people you are not so comfortable with. Practicing talking to small groups or two people that are not necessarily your best friends is the best course of action and learning how to be confident in these situations. As with all things, practice truly does make perfect. There are a ton a different activity that can be used on an individual or group basis to help with communication. Many companies throughout the world use them frequently to ensure that their team understands how well they communicate with each other. Finding these different activities is exceptionally simple. If you are looking for ways for your team to build better communication, I know that there are many resources out there that can help you. Chapter 6: Hypnosis In this chapter, we are going to get into the wonderful world of hypnosis. There are many different forms of hypnosis and their applications vary widely. Having an understanding of how hypnosis works, where it came from, and how it applies to things like NLP is important in ensuring you can get through the difficult thing we call life without being taken advantage of or manipulated for darker desires. When we think of hypnosis, we typically think of what is done on a stage for fun. You are one of your friends goes up and sits in a chair to become hypnotized. The hypnotist convinces you that you are some barnyard animal or other silly thing and makes you act it out. Upon the snap of their fingers you wake up with no recollection of what you had previously been doing. While this is a form of hypnosis it is not at all what actually goes on with clinical hypnosis. Many people have an issue with clinical hypnosis. This is due to the fact they they'd think of it the way that Hollywood portrays it. However, hypnosis can be very beneficial to a lot of people and helping them solve their issues. Most people don't actually understand what being hypnotized actually means. When you are under the influence of hypnosis you are more likely to accept suggestions. It is a heightened State of Consciousness that allows extreme focus. In addition, it is associated with being relaxed. When you are relaxed you are more able to take on the Improvement suggestions that people make to you. Getting your brain to relax can be very difficult and a hypnotic trance can help make it easier. Stage hypnosis can make it look like you can get a person to do absolutely anything. However, this is not true. Sure, your brain is more open to suggestions when you are in a hypnotized state, but it is very unlikely that you would do something that is not naturally in your will. If you don't like to act like a fool, it is unlikely that being hypnotized would cause you to do so. It is important to understand that not every person can be hypnotized. Part of the process is that the individual undergoing it needs to actually want to make a change and be hypnotized. For some people, it is simply impossible. They will not be able to reach the state that is considered a hypnotized trance where suggestions are easier to embed. Obviously, if you're undergoing this process you want to make sure that it is with a person that you trust to make a good suggestion for you. Typically, when people are being hypnotized It Is by their therapist. There are mixed results that come along with hypnosis. Some people find it to be very effective in helping them to stop participating in bad habits. This could be used to help a person quit smoking, stick to their weight loss plan, get past a bout of insomnia, or even help them to find forgotten memories. Hypnosis typically, does not work with one session. You will need to undergo this form of treatment several times to reinforce the positive suggestions that are being made. People have also found that getting in control of their anxiety can happen after some sessions of hypnosis. It is also good when managing pain. There are truly many different things that hypnosis can be beneficial to. Some researchers have even found that it can help with the negative side effects of dementia. Helping to jog memories that have been misplaced is great for those that start to lose them. You're probably wondering how hypnosis actually works. If you watch a lot of movies or you have been to a stage show that revolves around hypnosis you may have seen a slightly villainous looking person waving around a pocket watch. This, however, is not at all how hypnosis works. Hollywood has done a great job at causing misunderstanding toward what hypnosis actually is. When you are working with a psychologist or a therapist in hypnotherapy, they are not actually the ones that are hypnotizing you. They are simply there to help guide you along the path to becoming hypnotized. You are actually the vessel that causes the hypnosis. They help you learn the skills so that you can have hyper-focus and your mind will open up more easily to suggestion. You can actually practice hypnosis at home. By simply laying down in your bed in a dimly lit room and focusing on your breathing you can reach what they call a hypnotic trance. Once there, because you will still be in control of yourself, you can repeat mantras to help you stick to goals. Whether you are trying to lose weight and not eat that extra piece of cake or you haven't smoked in a while, but a cigarette sounds really good hypnosis can help you get past it. Working with a skilled hypnotist in the beginning is pretty important as they can help you learn the skills you need to be able to do this on your own. It is common to think that when you are in a hypnotic trance you are sleepy or zoned out. That is absolutely not the truth. As mentioned, you are actually hyper focused. This improved sense of awareness will allow you to accept suggestions more easily. You will find this to be especially true if you participate in several sessions of hypnosis with the same repetitive thoughts being suggested to you. There truly are some dramatic results that can come from this type of therapy. Hypnosis can affect people in very different ways. Depending on your strength of mind and character it may not work as well on you as it does with others. Many have suggested that it feels like an out-of-body experience. Some will be able to hold actual conversations while in a hypnotic trance while others will be able to barely mumble words. The type of person you are in the way your brain is wired will play a role in how well you receive hypnosis. In addition, it has a lot to do with how much you want it to work. If you are all in on this type of therapy, it is likely that you will get more out of it than someone who feels that it could never work for them. The question of isn't neuro-linguistic programming simply hypnosis crops up frequently. The simple answer to this question is, no. The use of NLP may consist of some hypnosis, however, there are several different techniques that are used in this type of treatment. So, now you can see that hypnotizing people can be part of the process, but they are vastly different things. Hypnosis relies heavily on suggestion. It helps you to change your habits or your belief patterns due to a constant repetitive piece of information that is going through the back door of your brain while you are in a hypnotized state. Neuro-linguistic programming Works quite a bit different. You will still be in that trance like State, however, it does not rely on suggestion. When your therapist is using neuro-linguistic programming and put you in a hypnotic trance they Are going to use the same thought patterns that are causing you issues. By altering these thought patterns you won't have the same bad associations with certain sights, smells, sounds, or other experiences. As you can see, hypnosis and neuro-linguistic programming hypnosis are a bit different as they go about helping you and prove yourself in different ways. Anchoring is a common technique that is used in NLP. In doing this a person well start to think about one of their happiest memories. One that makes them feel confident and proud of themselves. The hypnotist would then suggest that the person tuck their hair behind their ear. With repetition of this behavior when that person tucking their hair behind their ears in an everyday situation, it can help to bring on that feeling of happiness and confidence. This is a great example of anchoring and it can be used in many ways. The Father of Hypnosis Hypnosis is in the roots of neuro-linguistic programming. When they were first researching and developing this method, they studied a man by the name of Dr. Milton Erickson. He has often times been referred to as the “father of hypnosis”. His works have led to many different Therapies and they have helped a huge amount of people across the world. As a teenager, he's suffered from polio. This left him bedridden and unable to do a lot of things that normal healthy people can do. It took away His ability to do most things. Basically, he lay in bed all day and could hear what was going on around him. He could also see and move his eyes around, however, he was unable to speak or truly interact with those that were near. During this period of time, he learned to pay attention to people's body language. He could hear what was going on and surmise a lot more from the way that people were acting. It allowed him to further his theories after he became a psychologist. He learned from a young age that what people are saying is not necessarily what they are thinking and feeling. The importance of reading body language and movement became very apparent to him at the tender age of 17. He found that it was very simple to hear somebody say yes but realize that their body language was absolutely say no. As he moved on and healed from this medical disaster, he used this information in his thought process. Working through college He continued to study people and take notice of their indirect behavior. In fact, it helped him old many of his thoughts, theories, ideas, and books. The famed psychotherapist and psychologist thought that there was a better way to go about hypnotherapy. Rather than making hard suggestions he believed in subtlety. Making the effort to change a person's bad behaviors in a subtle way has proven to be more effective than in a more in-your-face type of way. Part of why his ways worked better than others is he truly believes that you need to understand where the person you are working with is coming from. This promotes better understanding on how you need to help them and what specific behaviors they need to work on changing. Erikson believed that a person's history only played a small role in their therapy. You do need a basic idea of what has happened in someone's life, however, a little bit of information goes a long way. He believes that focusing on the past didn't necessarily help to make changes in the present. With this belief he would only put a small amount of effort into learning about somebody's personal history. He found that focusing on what is happening in the here and now is more imperative to the person you are trying to improve. When somebody realizes that you are truly compassionate about their situation and want to help them, they are more accepting of making changes. Working through issues of the past may be important in some instances but for the most part, looking at what is happening right now is more important. Erickson worked on a method called indirect hypnosis. He believed that people go through different stages of hypnotic trances through their daily lives. Have you ever been on your way to work and get there without realizing that you drove there at all? many people call this autopilot; however, it really is a state of trance. While this may be an example of a very light trance it is still a good one. There are varying levels of hypnotic trances and depending on where you're at your mind's ability to take direct or indirect suggestions will also vary. Most people tend to find indirect hypnosis to be more ethical. In a clinical setting, it also tends to be more beneficial. Indirect hypnosis relies on body movements, subtle suggestions, stories, metaphors, and even jokes to help improve how patients are feeling and how they behave. Rather than having an in-your-face way of dealing with people his subtlety improves the responses that he would get. Naturally, people push against being told something directly if it is not how they feel or what they believe. So, his ability to indirectly influence thought patterns became exceptionally beneficial to not only his patience but others that use his theories. Direct hypnosis is much more abrasive. It is commanding of behavior from a person rather than suggesting it. People tend to fight against this more vehemently. Let's face it none of us want to be told what to do, whether we are in a trance or not. The indirect approach does tend to have much better results than the direct approach. Typically, direct hypnosis is performed on oneself. There are benefits to this type of hypnosis, however, and a clinical setting it is simply not as good. A good example to look at the differences in these two methods is to think about if somebody told you, “Don't eat that piece of cake it.” as compared to “You may actually be bored not hungry, what about doing something else?”. You can easily see the differences in these statements. People are much more apt to go with the second question rather than taking a command from their therapist. It is much more comfortable for both people involved to use a subtle type of hypnosis rather than a direct approach. We can't disagree with people when they state that they feel that direct hypnosis is unethical. It leaves the person being hypnotized with very little power. While our brains will not take to this type of hypnosis as easily it can be done. Put into the hands of the wrong person it could put you and your safety into jeopardy. Indirect hypnosis empowers the person that is undergoing it whereas direct can make them feel small and powerless. When NLP was being developed Erickson was one of the main focuses on the group researching it. They put together what they referred to as the Milton Model which are the methodologies that Erickson was using on a daily basis with his patients. In addition, it is the techniques that we're becoming truly successful for him. He was known to have better rates of success with his patients than many others which is why they focused on his work when putting together their ideas for neuro-linguistic programming. There are three main points that they came up with for this model. The first aspect that they focused on was building rapport. Erickson understood that it was very important for his clientele to trust him and open up to him. He was able to build fast rapport with his people by showing true compassion and concern for them. He would also used techniques like body language mirroring to make people feel more comfortable. He was naturally relaxed and paid attention to things like his facial expressions and tone of voice. All of these things play a major role in building confidence between people. The next aspect that they focused on was overloading conscious attention. This is a confusion tactic. By confusing the active mind, it opens up the subconscious mind to suggestion. He would do this by speaking in vague ways. He would use complex language patterns and words that most people would not commonly understand. This would throw the rational brain into a motive confusion and open up his ability to impact the subconscious mind. Ambiguity equals out to a lot of confusion for a rational mind. In doing this, he was able to make better suggestions to a subconscious mind as it is more open. The last aspect that was studied in this model was the use of indirect communication. Trying to get somebody to change the way they do something or the way they believe can be difficult when taking a direct approach. When we are told exactly what to do it is likely that we are going to do the opposite. By using an indirect approach, he was able to influence people to make better decisions and change the behaviors that they were looking to improve. It was easily seen that this indirect approach worked much better than the direct approach that many others had tried in the past. Ericksonian Hypnosis There are several different techniques that are linked to Ericksonian Hypnosis. Each technique will help to encourage a person into a certain type of behavior or way of thinking. It is not an in-your-face approach, but each technique should be looked at individually so that we can truly understand why Erickson did the things that he did and why he did them the way that he did them. Over the course of time his techniques have been proven effective. Some of them are more well-regarded than others, however, they all have their place in different settings. We feel as if it is easy to see why his techniques fit so seamlessly with neuro- linguistic programming. Reading body language and paying attention to all of your senses are major components of NLP. In addition, they are pretty big pieces of his thoughts and theories. Realistically, NLP would not exist as it is today without the principles and guidance of Milton Erickson. The group of people that are behind neuro-linguistic programming or very smart to take his practices into consideration. With a good hard look at what he was doing it is simple to understand why his methods were more effective than other psychotherapists that were practicing during his time. The first technique that we would like to discuss is encouraging resistance. Most therapists want to direct the conversation by asking questions about specific things. Erickson took a different approach and instead he encouraged his patient to talk about what they wanted to talk about. Due to the fact that these people were given a choice in what they were talking about it ended up that they were telling him more than anyone else. When you are leaving a conversation that can be very empowering and you are more apt to provide extra information then when you are being asked specific questions. Another technique that he frequently used was seeding ideas. Rather than using a direct approach, when people were in a trance, he would tell stories and use metaphors to help manipulate the unconscious mind. The human brain is much more susceptible to accepting this type of idea rather than one that is blatantly obvious. It allows us to come up with our own versions of the idea and feel as if it is our own rather than someone else's which is ultimately, easier to accept. He is also famous for his handshake technique. It is actually a very involved process but one that works quite well. A handshake is one of the most common forms of politeness when greeting a person. You can see this gesture happen all across the globe before a meeting starts, when you get to somebody's event, or through simple daily interactions. Whether people realize it or not when you shake someone's hand your brain is on autopilot. You simply do it without thinking and this is a trance-like state of mind. In turn, this means that your mind is more open to suggestions. Many people experienced this handshake with him, and it was discussed frequently in his books. There is a lot to learn in this technique and it can be very beneficial when trying to help people change their thought patterns and behaviors. He started his handshake with a firm grasp but then in the middle of it loosened it up and moved his fingers to touch certain pieces of a person's hand. This interrupts the autopilot thought pattern that goes along with a handshake. There was a lot more to it then this information, however, it would take far too long to explain it in detail. Be aware, there is plenty of information on this particular technique if you were wanting more information. Erickson was also Infamous for using techniques of confusion. In fact, you can see it through every piece of his theories on therapy. When you confuse the conscious mind it makes the subconscious mind more susceptible to indirect suggestions. He would have accomplished this confusion in a variety of ways. Using complex language, metaphors, jokes, and uncommon words he was able to change a person's thought pattern. By distracting a person's main train of thought he was able to make indirect suggestions to their subconscious mind. Another technique that works exceptionally well is focusing on the positive. By emphasizing the positive points of a person negative tendencies, you can get them to behave in a different way. It is a bit like reverse psychology. Ericsson had a lot to overcome in his life. As a young child he got polio and it forced him to learn to use his other senses. This is how he became so good at reading body language and seeing what was actually going on. Sure, this had left him tone deaf, partially paralyzed, and colorblind but in return it allowed him to learn how to truly read people. Pointing out the positives that can be found in negative situations and behaviors is truly advantageous in a therapeutic situation. The last technique in his theories that we want to look at is his use of shock therapy. We are not talking about using electrodes to blast electricity into someone. His version of shock therapy was to help people face their fears. His version of shock therapy was more like surprise therapy. When people were dealing with ridiculous issues like not leaving their homes because they felt as if they had small feet he was known to stomp on their foot and explain how anyone could want to be with somebody who has such large feet. Oftentimes, this left them feeling silly and they then had the ability to move on past such a silly fear. This technique is by far the least accepted of all of his. Most people are not happy with this technique as they feel it is stepping over a boundary. It is a bit abrasive. You won't find this technique and a lot of the training that is revolving around his thoughts and ideas. While it may be pushing some bounds it was quite effective for the people that he used it web. Conquering fears can be extremely difficult and when they are pushed in front of you it can be easier to deal with on the hole. There is a huge number of people that can benefit from the work that this psychologist did. It can help to combat a variety of different psychosis and ailments within the human mind. It has been proven over time that his theories work much better than many others. There are practical applications of his thoughts and techniques that people use in their everyday lives consistently. They have found that it leads to a better quality of life and a more stable mental environment. People who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, addiction, obesity issues, or problems with controlling their habits can find great benefit from his teachings. The way that he went about helping people with these types of disorders was quite a bit different than others in his field at the time. Today, his practices are commonly seen in many different types of therapy. People also use these techniques when they are trying to lose weight, work on their relationships, or they are trying to manage their pain. They're truly are a plethora of different applications that his methodologies can be used in. Many therapists and psychologists today rely on the works of Erickson. This is because his tactics have been proven quite effective over the course of time. You will find his teachings and techniques being used in marriage counseling, family therapy, behavioral disorder therapist, and many others in the same realm. You may even find that nurses and medical professionals use some of his techniques when dealing with people. Realistically, you can see his practice is all over the world. This is true because so many of the things that he researched and truly believed in working and helping to make people the best versions of themselves. Additionally, they have helped to correct negative behaviors that people have been struggling with for their entire lives. Neuro-linguistic programming and Ericksonian Hypnosis go hand-in-hand. One can be used without the other, however, many people find that using them together will give the best results. Many therapists throughout the globe use them in conjunction with each other because it is such a solid method for helping people get over a variety of different issues. Whether you are struggling with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder or overeating this type of therapy can be very beneficial in helping you overcome the problem. Neuro-linguistic programming and Ericksonian Hypnosis are both based on subtlety. They allow you to change your way of thinking by learning more about what's going on inside of you and around you. With small changes come much larger ones in the grand scheme of things. By combining the efforts of three different psychologists and therapists NLP was born. When the group that put together the thoughts and ideas on neuro-linguistic programming decided to study different therapists they found some common denominators and all of them. Each of these people for finding greater success with their patients than most others. Why was this? Well, because they paid attention to the fine details of human behavior. They not only listen to what their clients had to say but they watched what they were doing. In looking at their body language and adjusting their own they were able to truly build a great rapport and level of trust with the people they were working with. Erikson's version of hypnosis was quite a different thing than the direct approaches that many others were taking. It appeared to be more ethical because it was more suggestive than in your face. When we are learning about neuro-linguistic programming it is all about noticing subtleties and people. Not only in people, but also in ourselves. It's paying attention to facial movements, voice inflection, posture, and general body movements. These are all subtleties that are not usually paid attention to buy the average person. By combining what they have learned from each of the psychotherapist and psychologist that they studied is that these subtle tactics simply worked better than others. Ericksonian hypnosis takes advantage of the unconscious mind. It is a bit about distraction. By keeping the focused mind a bit confused our subconscious is more susceptible to taking suggestions. Not only that, it's not really taking a direct order but figuring out the best course of action through storytelling, jokes, and redirection. We all go through trance-like States on a daily basis and Erikson simply learned to take advantage of that to help people become better. His theories help set the basis for neuro-linguistic programming. We all have similar patterns in the way that we speak, think, and act. The patterns are consistent and easy to see when you know what you are looking for. With training in NLP and Ericksonian hypnosis it becomes easier and easier to see exactly what you are looking at. This will allow you, as a therapist, to help people gain better control over their thought patterns and their lives. These teachings can also help people in their everyday lives. Let's face it, there are a lot of bad people out there that are wishing to do harmful things to you or people that you love. Having the skills and abilities to notice the small changes in their demeanor can help you pinpoint the people that are up to no good. It does take a lot of practice and hard work to be able to spot these small inconsistencies in the way people are behaving, however, it is truly advantageous and keeping yourself safe. For more than forty years NLP and Ericksonian Hypnosis has been very successful in treating people. As noted, the subtlety of this form of therapy is astounding. It truly helps to reprogram someone's brain into thinking a different way. allowing your thought patterns to maintain the same direction that they used to but altering them has great effect. You'll be using what used to hurt you to empower you. You will find that not everyone has great belief in these practices, however, there have been many great successes using it. That is why so many people are still studying it today. Unlike regular forms of hypnosis ericksonian hypnosis gives gentle commands instead of direct ones. Our brains like this form of alteration much better as it is more acceptable to our conscious mind. The effects of it tend to stick more quickly than those of standard hypnosis. In addition, the practices of neuro linguistic programming also tend to stick around longer because they are less in your face. These theories put together will allow someone to make true conscious choices in their lives. Rather than running on instinct that can get you into trouble quickly you'll be able to look at each situation and consciously decide what you want to do. Obviously, with this kind of power you need to be careful and kind to those that are around you. If you are around people that are very observant, they may notice the skills and tactics you are using to get your own way and make your own outcomes. This is what makes this kind of learning dangerous. People with ill-will in their hearts could use it against you or others around you. Knowing what to look for will keep everybody protected. Ericksonian hypnosis can happen right in front of your eyes. It is not the type of hypnosis that we commonly think of. With subtle changes of everyday actions and the attention paid to the random trances that we go into throughout our days it can be accomplished. He was able to do this with simple things like handshakes. So, once you start to learn these techniques you will start to realize that there are others trying to use them against you. Knowing what you're dealing with is the biggest hurdle. The principles of these two techniques, neuro-linguistic programming and Ericksonian hypnosis, can give you true advantages in your world. It can lead to a happier and much healthier life. That is, as long as you're using it for the right reasons. Chapter 7: Detection and Personality Safety In our last chapter we are going to look over how to tell if somebody is trying to take advantage of you. In addition, we are going to try and make it easier for you to spot manipulation. When you have a good idea of what is going on with the people around you and we mean truly knowing what they're planning it can help to keep you safer in a lot of situations. We will look over how to be exceptionally mindful in what you do on a daily basis and ways that you can build your self-esteem. When you are trying to understand human behavior it's important to understand yourself. Looking at your verbal and nonverbal skills can allow you better insight as to what other people are thinking because you won't understand how their bodies work as compared to your own. Trying to figure out when somebody is taking advantage of you can be difficult. There are absolutely signs that you can watch out for. In fact, there are a lot of different great articles surrounding the thoughts of if somebody is or is not trying to take advantage of you. With the ability to see when somebody's intentions are less than pure you will keep yourself better protected and in turn, lead a happier life. It can be very frustrating when you're uncertain of someone's intentions and even worse when you find out they were simply around to take advantage of you. People are pretty crafty, and they will use your emotions against you. Some people love to feign confusion. You may have made it very clear what your expectations are, and they simply pretend that they don't understand. If it is somebody that you know fairly well it can be easy to see that they are trying to take advantage of you because you may know that they're quite smart and usually catch on to things quickly. However, if you're dealing with somebody you don't know very well you may just assume that they're not very intelligent and need a lot of direction to get something done. They're active confusion can be frustrating and leave you dealing with whatever it was you asked of them. In a relationship, feigning confusion can be horribly detrimental. Let's say that you know your girlfriend or boyfriend is cheating on you, but they simply play dumb. You may not have exact proof and in their ability to act confused or non-understanding of what you are saying can leave you two sticking with a detrimental situation. Pay close attention to the person you are dealing with so that you can have a good understanding of whether or not they actually have the capacity to get what you are saying. Some also really like to play the victim. You've probably met a person or two in your life that does this. Everything that is going on with them is simply terrible. They do this so that they can have your attention and get you to do what they want. Sympathy is a powerful feeling. If somebody is working through a hardship, naturally, good people want to help them. Somebody with malicious intent will use this to their advantage. Knowing that you are a good person or realizing that you help people around you can encourage them to play the part of the victim to gain your trust and sympathy. People that play the victim tend to do it in their everyday lives. Each person that they come into contact with they have another sob story to make them feel bad. If you are around somebody that has a generally negative attitude this could be because they like to play the victim. Some people do it unconsciously, but others do it to get you under their thumb. Be careful when you're handing out sympathy and empathy for those around you and make sure that they deserve it. In today's world we hear a lot about shaming. This can be done in a variety of ways and it is insanely detrimental. It can start out with little digs about the way you look, feel, or. It may be that you did not do something up to the standard of the person speaking to you. In the real world, they are simply doing this to get you under their thumb. When people give us critiques it can be difficult to understand that they may not be true. Human beings, naturally, take things to Heart. Shame is a very powerful feeling that can tear you down quickly. Once you start feeling ashamed of yourself and one way or another it is difficult to pull yourself out of it. So recognizing when somebody is simply trying to shame you into submission is important for your mental health. Using shame does not necessarily always making digs. If you have met a very sarcastic person, they could be using their sarcasm to make you feel ashamed. This type of behavior is unacceptable, and it should be acknowledged from the very beginning. There is a time and a place for sarcasm but when it is making you feel terrible about yourself you need to put a stop to it right away. Otherwise, you may be given control of yourself and your life to somebody else. Divert Attention When people are trying to take advantage of you, they may use diversion techniques. By throwing you off of a certain thought or path they can easily change the subject and get the eyes off of them. Being aware and staying on track of what you were saying is important. This goes hand-in-hand with knowing what you're going to say and spending the time to think before you speak. With clear concise thoughts you won't have to worry about people trying to divert your attention away from them. When people try to divert attention often, they are trying to pass the blame on to somebody else. This is a very dangerous game and can end up pitting you against a friend, co-worker, or family member. So, as noted it's extremely important to have your thoughts collected before entering into any sort of serious conversation. It truly can help to ensure that you do not get taken advantage of by those that are skilled and diversion techniques. Some people will do their very best to make you feel guilty in order to be able to take advantage of you. This commonly happens with people that know you better than others. When those around you are aware of the fact that you strive to be a good person it can, absolutely, be used against you. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be a good person, but it does tends to make people feel more guilty when they've done something wrong. Everyone has moments in time where they're not the best person and that's okay. Accepting the fact that everyone makes mistakes can help to ensure that those around you cannot use guilt to control you. Sure, most of us want to make good decisions and do the right thing by not only ourselves but those that are around us. Knowing that this is not always the case and we all have screw-ups is very helpful. Guilt is a common denominator and taking control over somebody or using them to your advantage. Denial Denial is another component that people frequently used to take advantage of others. If you don't have hard evidence against somebody what is to stop them from simply saying no I didn't do that. It then comes down to your word against theirs. If somebody is vehemently denying what you are saying eventually you start to believe it. You may question the information and where you got it. This can cause distrust among those that you trust the most. Denial is dangerous especially when you trust your sources. Hearsay is a difficult thing to prove, however, it can be very detrimental to someone's psyche. As you start to doubt whether or not your accusations are true you may also start to doubt other things in your life. This allows control to the person that is making all of the denials. They can pray on this to try and bend you to their well. In addition, once they have made you accept the fact that their denial is true they might start looking for favors. Neuro-linguistic programming skills can really help in this department. Most people that are quick to deny something have some facial movements or body movements to give them away. When you start to study these techniques, it can be much more simple to figure out who is riding the denial train. When you understand that somebody is simply denying the accusations to save face or keep them self out of trouble it becomes easier to figure it out and understand that is what's going on. Lie Liars are all around us. From the time we are little there are lies in our lives. Ones that we have told and ones that others have told us. Liars are, typically, trying to take advantage of you. Sometimes the lie that is told is quite harmless and can be brushed off. Other times, they are major lies that can ruin lives. We talked a bit about lying earlier and when it comes down to it every person in the world tells a lie on occasion. When we tell a lie with good intent it doesn't make it much better than align with mal intent, but it is more understandable. Sometimes it is simply easier to tell a white lie than it is to hurt somebody's feelings or cause turmoil for somebody that you care about. Then there are the other types of Lies, the big ones. These can affect not only your daily life and relationships but also your job. When people are telling a lot late and lies it can be very difficult to deal with. Emotions may become heightened, especially, if you know for a fact that they are lying. This can make you act out in a way that you normally would not. Obviously, if you're at work and you have a major meltdown because somebody thought you trusted is telling a major lie it's going to lead to trouble. Spotting Liars can be difficult so be careful who you decide to put your full trust into. The daily liar is exceptionally dangerous. They make small embellishments and I have a story for everything. You may learn to trust this person very easily as it seems they are quite open and honest. Realistically, people that talk too much about themselves or what they have done in their life should be looked at a bit skeptically. It takes time to open up and so those that just continuously talk are likely lying to you in one way or another. People that rely on lying to get through their daily lives become very good at it. They are completely comfortable with telling these mistruths to just about anyone. It can be hard to pick out a liar but with practice and attention to detail it can become easier. Know that the liar is always trying to prey on somebody even if it is for a simple joke or to make themselves feel better. Ever come into contact with someone that simply blows you off? They make plans but then never get back to you or you know they've read a message and are simply not responding. These people are absolutely trying to take advantage of you. Don't get us wrong, some people just get busy and don't have the time to respond. However, it continues you can be fairly sure that they are playing some sort of game. This type of behavior is commonly referred to as selective inattention. Some days, you may find that the person you are dealing with his right there helping you with everything you need. Then for the next two days you simply can't get ahold of them. They become very distant and closed off, even when you need help. Oftentimes, this type of behavior is thought out. Planned selective inattention can give power and control to the person that is ignoring you. They understand that people get frustrated when they're being ignored. When someone is being ignored, they typically work harder to get attention. This makes the person ignoring you hold the power. You are striving for their attention and they are simply letting you do it. Seduction Another way that people try to take advantage of others is with seduction. Let's face it, we all want to be accepted in love. Some people will use charm and flattery to get you on their side of the fence. They make you feel truly special but then end up simply getting what they want. They honestly, don't care about you one way or the other. Recognizing when somebody is trying to seduce you can be very difficult. Obviously, if you are in a relationship and somebody is hitting on you it may be easier to blow off. Other times, when you're single and lonely, you are leaving yourself completely open to being taken advantage of. This can happen in your dating life, work life, or even in your everyday life. Seduction seriously plays with your emotions. Your mental stability is being challenged when you allow somebody to seduce you. Taking the time to truly get to know someone before you fall for their witty comments and compliments is crucial and keeping yourself protected against being taken advantage of. You can ward off this kind of behavior by setting clear ground rules from the beginning. It doesn't matter if you are talking with a future lover or your boss. When people understand the ground that you keep it makes them less apt to try and take advantage of you and your emotions. Those that take advantage of your emotions are the worst as it can be very difficult to separate your rational thinking from your emotional thinking. When you practice NLP and start to really get into the inner workings of it, it can definitely keep you better protected from these emotional abusers. You will make the choice on whether or not somebody has the ability to affect you. Not only that, you will have the ability to make the choice of what that affect is going to be. Having better control over yourself and your emotions is always going to help he be better protected against those who would like to play on them. Manipulation Manipulation is another huge issue in being taken advantage of. It is seriously, its own Monster. Learning when somebody is trying to manipulate you into doing something you wouldn't normally do is important. It may be something small and insignificant, however, it's surprising how huge manipulation can become. You may find that you are all about following the rules and all of a sudden somebody has talked you into breaking a lot. Obviously, this could land you with some very serious repercussions. The ability to spot manipulation is something that can be practiced. Like all skills you'll need to hone it. Being manipulated doesn't feel good, especially once you realize that it has happened. If you're lucky, you'll notice that somebody is trying to manipulate you before you start doing things outside of your nature. At one point or another most people are able to pinpoint a spot in their life that they were manipulated. Typically, the feelings surrounding that don't feel very good. No one likes to be manipulated so understanding when it's happening is critical. So, how do we know when we're being manipulated? The signs for manipulation are exactly the signs of being taken advantage of. These two things are quite synonymous. There are manipulators all over the world, some of them are easy to spot and others are masters of the craft. The only true way to know if you're being manipulated is to take the time in getting to know someone. Studying them and understanding what their movements, tone of voice tone, words, and other actions actually mean. Having the ability to see these things is not an ability that comes naturally or easily to everyone. As noted, studying the techniques of neuro-linguistic programming and understanding some about Dark Psychology and the Dark Triad can help you be better armed against those that will take advantage of you. It will take time and possibly a great amount of effort but eventually you'll start to notice more and more about what is going on around you. This will give you the armor you need to ensure that you are the one in control of your life and not other people. Mindfulness A great way to add to your arsenal of maintaining control of yourself and not allowing others to take advantage or manipulate you is to practice the art of mindfulness. Mindfulness is something that we can practice every single day. There are truly some very simple exercises that can help you become more aware of what is going on around you and inside of you. Being mindful can help keep you well protected against those who wish to do you harm or have you do their bidding. It is understandable that not everybody has a long period of time in a day to sit and meditate. You don't have to have a lot of time to become more mindful. It can truly only take a few minutes per day and you'll be surprised by the results. You will notice a lot more of what is happening around you and this is, obviously, advantageous to you and your overall well-being. One exceptionally simple exercise that you can do pretty much at any point throughout your day is breathing mindfully. This means that you will change your focus from whatever it is that is in front of you and simply focus on breathing in and breathing out. Notice how it feels, the sound it makes to you, and the speed at which it is happening. The more mindful you are of your breathing the more you'll be able to focus on other things around you with continued practice. Mindful listening is also a very easy exercise that can help to improve your senses. When you have a few minutes, you can simply close your eyes and take in, literally, every noise around you. Whether you are in the office or out for a walk in the woods The Sounds will change dramatically. Home in on each one individually. Noticed what the sound is. the tone of it, how it makes you feel, and how it interacts with the other sounds in the room. This practice can be done for 30 seconds or even longer. Finding the time to do it should be barely an inconvenience. Mindful observation is a great tool to have in your kit. This is the one that is going to allow you to notice the behaviors of the people around you. By sitting back and observing what is going on without participating in it it is surprising how many different things you will notice. We're not only talking about observing the people around you but also the surrounding itself. Let's say you're sitting in a board meeting and you notice that the person in the corner is a little more agitated than everyone else. By looking around the room you may notice that the air is circulating to every place except for that corner. It is likely, the person is feeling irritated because they're overheated. This may not be something that a person would notice without practicing mindful observation. Mindful observation is also excellent in pretty much every aspect of your life. This really does go with the belief system behind neuro-linguistic programming. It is simply about taking notice to everything that is going on around you but only one piece at a time. I notice sing the simple things you can figure out a lot of the big things. It takes time to become attuned and aware of everything that is going around you. Here again, you need to understand that practice makes perfect. The more time you give yourself to practice this technique the easier it will become to notice what is really happening. Self-Esteem Building your self-confidence or self-esteem is another great way to ensure that people will not take advantage of you. When you are sure of yourself you don't have to worry about your beliefs being bent by a clever talk. It also makes it more clear when people are telling you lies or trying to deceive you. Having self-confidence can be very difficult in the world we live in today. Oftentimes, we get torn down by everyone around us. This tactic can be very harmful especially when used with Mal intent. When you do have good self- esteem, you won't have to worry about the harmful effects of detrimental talk. There are quite a few ways that you can help build your confidence. Self- esteem building is something that should happen on a daily basis. Just like becoming more aware it only takes a few minutes every day. Let's take a look at a few things you can do to help boost your confidence and self-esteem with just a few minutes of practice every day. Affirmations or mantras are an excellent way to boost your self-esteem. By telling yourself repeatedly that you are worthy of love or that You have beautiful skin can really help. When we repeatedly tell ourselves the same thing our mind starts to accept them more easily. So, instead of tearing yourself apart you can start building yourself up. If you find that you have a hard time repeating something to yourself, you can make a postcard and stick it to your mirror. This will allow you to see it every time you go to the mirror and you will unconsciously read it. Another thing you can do to help build your self-esteem is to visualize yourself just exactly as you want you to be. This is going to take a bit more time and can be difficult for some people. However, when you start to see yourself as the superhero reaching all of your goals in the most beautiful of fashions it can be truly helpful. Finding the negative aspects about ourselves as easy as compared to finding the positive ones. Thinking about yourself as your very best version can help you change the habit of picking yourself apart. Along with this thought, you should question the critic that lives inside of you. Surely you have heard the phrase, “you are your own worst enemy”. This is because it's true. We tend to critique ourselves much harder than those around us. Taking the time to think why you truly are feeling that way about yourself is important. There are a variety of therapies that revolve around getting you to understand that you are simply being too hard on yourself. A lot of times when people have low self-esteem or low confidence because they're not truly taken care of themselves. We don't simply mean going to the gym and eating healthy. These two things do play a part and overall well- being, but your mental health is insanely important. If you are suffering from a lack of confidence in taking care of your brain might be exactly the thing that you need. Spending time to focus on the positives of life and becoming more mindful will lead to mental clarity and can oftentimes help build a person's confidence. Finding the ability to set boundaries can also be very helpful in building confidence. It's understandable that saying no can be difficult, however, it is necessary. Letting people know where your lines in the sand are will stop them from easily taking advantage of you. Being assertive is not simple for all people. Some of us are simply not wired that way. There are many tactics and which you can help yourself to become more assertive. In fact, you can even take classes on this. Once you start to set boundaries the people around you will have more respect for you. In turn, you will find that you have more respect for yourself. Changing your thought pattern about where you stand in society is also a good way to improve self-esteem. If you spend time thinking that you are less than others it can be truly mentally painful. Changing your thought patterns seeing yourself as an equal can help improve not only your mood but also your self-esteem. Having the realization that no one is any better than anyone else is an epiphany that everyone needs to have. Sure, someone might do something better than you but certainly there is something that you do better than them. Understanding that all things will balance is very important and making sure that you have excellent confidence and self-esteem. Many self-esteem and confidence issues come from fear. Something you can do to help improve your self-esteem and your level of confidence is to face at least one fear every single day. Removing yourself from your comfort zone will make it easier when a new fear pops up. You won't be afraid to stand up and give your opinion in that meeting or the thought of leaving your house becomes less and less of a big deal. It may be a bit shocking at first and difficult to face your fears, however, once you start doing it you will feel the liberation that it brings. True Freedom can be found when learning how to face your fears. Understanding human behavior can be very complicated. We are all wired a bit differently so pinpointing one aspect of somebody against another can be very difficult. When we start to understand ourselves better, we can also understand others better. All of this comes down to verbal and nonverbal communication. The way that we deal with each other truly shows the intentions that we have. Non-Verbal Communication As noted, nonverbal communication is one of the most important things that you can learn. What people are doing truly will show you how they feel, what they are thinking, and possibly what their intentions are. When you can understand the nonverbal cues that someone is giving to you will be better protected towards ill-natured intent. It takes a lot of practice and mindfulness to be able to truly understand nonverbal communication. Focusing on one aspect at a time will allow you to put it all together. There are many different areas of nonverbal communication and studying them singularly will help immensely. Taking the time to learn about body language, movement, tone of voice, posture, and other pieces of nonverbal communication will take time. Each one of them is equally as important as the other. When you start to focus on yourself and the way you communicate to non-verbally it will definitely be easier to understand what others are trying to actually say. Not falling for the words that come out of somebody's mouth hook, line, and sinker is absolutely advantageous. When you can pay attention to all of the aspects of what is going on with them it will be much more difficult for them to pull the wool over your eyes. Nonverbal communication is insanely important to understand, and each person should spend some time in their lives learning about it.
