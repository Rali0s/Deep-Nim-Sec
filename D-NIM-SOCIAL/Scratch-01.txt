The Marketplace Application design addresses how it would be integrated into a marketplace ecosystem.
The response focuses on technical integration into SOAR/SIEM platforms, but does not describe how the app would be integrated into a commercial marketplace ecosystem for distribution or billing.

Suggests potential technologies or platforms for implementation.
The response mentions integration targets (Splunk, Sentinel, Phantom, Resilient) and data formats (JSON/YAML), but does not suggest technologies or platforms for the actual implementation/development of the API or app itself.

Elastic, Splunk, Sentinel, Crowdstrike Falcon, DataDog


Mentions data formats relevant for technical integration, such as JSON/YAML.
The response mentions "JSONB" in the context of PostgreSQL for data storage, not as a data format for technical integration or API communication between different systems, which was the context of the original prompt's mention of JSON/YAML.

Elastic Query Language Poses A Solution - We need to share our output DataDog/APM/RUM Data into a Unified JSONB or Similar Format. We will need a connector to Parse JSON on Elastic or Other SIEMs but let's see if we can use Native Builds first. A Seamless connection is ideal.
