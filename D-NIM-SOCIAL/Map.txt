REPLIT/FIGMA DESIGN & BUILD SPECIFICATION: SPECTRUM OS CONSOLE
SPECIFICATION 001-A: FRONT-END VISUALIZATION PROTOCOL (FIGMA/REACT)
PROJECT STATUS: Project Nightingale Beta. Design MUST strictly adhere to Obsidian/Electric Cyan aesthetic (Vercel/Nvidia GUI style).

I. CORE DESIGN THESIS & LAYOUT (FIGMA)
The design must emulate a hyper-efficient, high-performance tactical dashboard focused on data density and low-latency readability.

A. Aesthetic Protocol: Obsidian/Electric Cyan
Element	Specification	Value	Figma Implementation
Background (Primary)	Obsidian Black (Base)	#0A0A0A	Solid dark base layer, minimal texture.
Data/Accent 1 (Primary)	Electric Cyan / Teal	#00C8FF	Used for active metrics, borders, chart lines, and hover states.
Accent 2 (Warning/Risk)	Muted Neon Green	#39FF14	Used for CRITICAL/HIGH risk indicators and active terminal cursor.
Typography	Primary: Inter (Semi-Bold for headers)	Sans-Serif	Ensures high legibility on dark background.
Monospace (Code/Data)	JetBrains Mono or Fira Code	Monospace	Used for all NimScore values, IDs, and console outputs.
Component Style	Zero-shadow, 1px low-opacity borders (Accent 1), sharp corners (optional 2px radius max).	Minimalist	Avoids 3D effects; focus on data integrity.
B. Layout Structure: Dual-Mode Modular Grid
The interface must be a dynamic, three-column grid optimized for 1920x1080 resolution.

Left Pane (Navigation/Global Metrics): Persistent narrow column (approx. 15% width). Must display Mode Toggle (SPEAR / SHIELD) and key persistent metrics (e.g., Global NimScore, CMU Status: STREAMING).
Central Pane (Working Area): Primary data view (approx. 65% width). Content changes based on Mode selection. Must be designed to host the Vector Forge node graph or the Control Bridge matrices.
Right Pane (Console/Feedback/Log): Fixed log and input area (approx. 20% width). Must feature a Command Palette input field and a real-time system message log (> ALERT:).
II. CORE COMPONENT & DATA SPECIFICATION (REPLIT/REACT)
The Replit build must prioritize the instantiation and visual display of the platform’s unique data lexicon.

A. Visualization Priority: CMU Data
The primary display element must be the visual representation of Behavioral Susceptibility:

Psycho-Exploitability Map Widget: A dynamic heat map visualization (preferably using a charting library like Recharts/Nivo) in the Central Pane. Colors must range from deep #0A0A0A (Low Susceptibility) to bright #39FF14 (CRITICAL Susceptibility).
Data Requirement: Must visualize the correlation between Organizational Role (Y-Axis) and Key Bias Exploited (X-Axis).
Metrics Blocks: Dedicated 1x1 widgets displaying the following values using Monospace font and Electric Cyan text:
NimScore (vBETA) (e.g., 0.85)
Exploitability Window (e.g., 86%)
Behavioral Susceptibility Score (e.g., 0.80)
B. Vector Forge Interface (SPEAR Mode)
When SPEAR Mode is active, the Central Pane must display the modular build environment:

Node Graph Simulation: Visual representation of an attack path (e.g., Email Node -> Click Node -> Credential Harvest Node). Nodes should be distinct, bordered in Cyan, and feature status indicators (e.g., SUCCESS (4 HARVESTS) in Neon Green).
CMU Tuning Panel: A collapsible sidebar widget allowing selection of the Psychological Anchor (e.g., Urgency Bias) and display of the resulting Persuasion Coefficient (PC) (e.g., 0.79).
C. SHIELD Mode Interface: Control Bridge
When SHIELD Mode is active, the Central Pane must display the remediation and compliance structure:

Human Patch Queue: A structured, filterable list of remediation tasks. Must visually differentiate Priority Levels (P1, P2, P3) using colored tags (P1: Neon Green, P3: Muted Cyan).
Data Requirement: Each task must display the target bias (e.g., Target: Authority Bias) and the required control (e.g., NIST AT-2).
Risk Drift Monitor Chart: A line graph tracking the historical performance of the NimScore (vBETA) over time, clearly indicating the Target NimScore line.
III. MANDATORY LEXICON AND SYSTEM OUTPUTS
The application must support the stylized rendering of system messages and lexicon:

Element	Visual Representation	Example
System Alert	Blockquote style, slightly lighter background shade.	> ALERT: deep-nimsec-v1 Calibration complete.
IDs & Metrics	Inline code block, Monospace font.	NimScore (vBETA): 0.85
Headers	Bolded, uppercase, using Cyan accent.	### SYSTEM HEALTH
ACTION: Proceed with Figma design based on this aesthetic protocol. The Replit build must prioritize the modular grid structure and the accurate visualization of CMU-derived metrics.
